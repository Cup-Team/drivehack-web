        "title": "Kleiner Perkins leads $30M raise for Zumper to meet flexible, short-term rental demand",
        "text": "One consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is more people had flexibility to work remotely, and that meant they also had more flexibility to live where they wanted.As a result, more people chose to relocate \u2014 either temporarily or permanently \u2014 to other cities.For online rental marketplace Zumper, this meant a shift in user demand. The San Francisco company historically has connected renters to landlords for long-term leases, with short-term rentals only being a very small portion of its business.But in 2021, as more people began to explore other locales, Zumper saw \u201ca significant subset\u201d of its renters looking for more flexible options, such as month-to-month or hybrid leases.\u00a0For the unacquainted, a hybrid lease is typically for one to six months with no fixed contract. It also can be described as \u201ca rolling lease,\u201d in that tenants have short notice periods to leave.\u201cWe saw that our users wanted more flexibility in their lives,\u201d said CEO and co-founder Anthemos \u201cAnth\u201d Georgiades. \u201cSome just want to be nomadic and some just want to try various neighborhoods before committing long-term.\u201dLast year, Zumper had about 1 million listings and over 70 million users. Of that 70 million, about one-third were seeking short-term rentals of apartments, hotels or condos, according to Georgiades. To better cater to that subset of users, Zumper today is announcing what the founder describes as a \u201crebirth.\u201dTo that end, the company has raised $30 million in a Series D1 round of funding led by Kleiner Perkins to help it in its efforts to enhance its product to better serve people looking for short-term rental options.The funding actually closed earlier this year, but is only being announced today. Goodwater, Greycroft and other unnamed investors also participated in the financing, which brings the company s total raised to nearly $180 million.Zumper had raised $60 million in a Series D round in March of 2020. Despite the latest raise being an extension of that round, Georgiades told TechCrunch that the company saw a \u201csignificant step up\u201d in valuation. (Typically, valuations are flat when extension rounds are raised).The executive declined to disclose the figure at which Zumper is currently valued, but sources familiar with the company s internal operations told TechCrunch that it is now \u201cabove $500 million.\u201dHe did say that the money has mostly gone toward funding the product development toward all the above trends. Already, Zumper has added more than half a million short-term listings to meet customer demand.With a push into short-term rental offerings, is Zumper encroaching on Airbnb s territory? Notably, Airbnb also shifted course during the pandemic by offering more longer-term stays on its platform.Acknowledging that there is \u201csome overlap,\u201d Georgiades said Zumper is \u201cfocused on helping people find places to live versus Airbnb being focused on helping people find places to stay, often when they travel or on vacation.\u201d\u201cAirbnb did a great job in the pandemic catering to flexible rentals,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cWe see a\u00a0 slightly different approach to flexible rentals with significantly lower fees to renters and most of our users staying for one to six months versus a stay. I wouldn t say we re going head to head against Airbnb, nor are we trying to kind of get into the vacation rental space against them, but we do see an opportunity as a true rental platform to deliver in this flexible world slightly differently.\u201dIlya Fushman, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, notes that the venture firm has invested in each of Zumper s funding rounds since its 2012 inception, starting with a $1 million seed round that year announced two weeks after launching into a public beta at SF Disrupt. Other backers in that early financing included Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), NEA and Greylock.\u201cFinding a home is a fundamental need and has to evolve with the way people live and work today,\u201d Fushman wrote via email. \u201cZumper has built a modern, highly flexible, cost effective, and high quality inventory experience that allows people to find the best places to live.\u201dHe went on to describe Zumper as \u201cthe first real estate marketplace to offer annual, monthly and nightly rental options in geographies that people desire.\u201d\u201cPeople who are renting homes today are focused on mobility, flexibility and a high quality software experience, and Zumper delivers on all of these,\u201d Fushman added.Investors were drawn to what Georgiades described as a post-vaccine \u201cexplosion\u201d of interest from renters in 2021.That explosion has led to double-digit revenue growth year-over-year, he said.With a self-described mission of making renting \u201cas easy as booking a hotel,\u201d Zumper competes with the likes of publicly traded Zillow, Apartments.com and CoStar.\u00a010 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemicThe company makes money by charging multi-family and single-family landlords a subscription to its platform to get their inventory in front of Zumper s users. For example, it works with companies like Blueground to get its furnished apartments in front of more potential tenants. While it feels like a SaaS offering in that landlords typically pay Zumper via annual contracts, Georgiades describes its long-term offering as \u201ca classic advertising business.\u201d In the short-term space, it s a bit more transactional, with the company taking a fee at the point when the rental is booked at an average of 10% of the booking value generated.But not wanting to make the same mistake as many other companies that saw pandemic-related bumps in business, Zumper is not putting all its eggs in one basket.\u201cLong-term rentals remain our core offering,\u201d Georgiades said. \u201cAt the same time, we absolutely believe flexible is here to stay. I don t think demand will return to as high as it was last year, but it s still a massive segment that is underserved with no one who s really built a marketplace for it, and we think that s a big opportunity.\u201dThe rental market is a hot one these days. Last week, storied venture firm Andreessen Horowitz wrote its largest individual check ever, at $350 million, to Flow, Adam Neumann s new residential real estate company focused on rentals. That company, unlike Zumper, aims to be a property management company.",

        "title": "Tier Mobility lays off 180 people amid poor funding climate",
        "text": "Tier Mobility, the German micromobility giant that recently acquired Spin from Ford, is laying off 16% of staff, or 180 people, according to a LinkedIn post by CEO Lawrence Leuschner and an open letter from the executive that has been viewed by TechCrunch.\u201cUltimately, we have to respond to the current economic and funding climate, reducing the number of projects and business lines we are focussing on as a company in order to accelerate our path to profitability,\u201d wrote Leuschner.Leuschner also noted that he s committed to helping those who were laid off find new roles. Tier has set up a Tier Alumni page with details of the people who are leaving to assist recruiters. While Tier has not responded to TechCrunch s requests for more information, the layoffs appear to span a variety of teams, mostly in Berlin, with the highest concentration of layoffs coming from marketing, market development and technology teams. Most employees were informed by team leaders in \u201c1-2-1\u201d meetings Tuesday morning, according to Leuschner s letter.Tier s decision to cut staff is the latest in a string of tech startup layoffs that are particularly concentrated in late-stage companies that are finding the current economic climate a difficult one in which to raise extension rounds and grow into their valuations. Tier was previously valued at $2 billion.The transportation space has not been immune to this. In June, Bird laid off 23% of its staff, or about 140 workers, due to a dire need to tighten its belt and restructure internally. Last month Lyft let go of 2% of its staff, or about 60 employees, as it shut down its in-house car rental program. And this week Ford Motor Company said it that plans to lay off 3,000 employees as it restructures toward electrification.The news from Tier comes as the micromobility operator appeared to be on an upswing after raising $200 million in October last year and going on a startup shopping spree. Last November, Tier acquired Nextbike to double down on its commitment to offering e-bikes, as well as e-scooters. In December, the company bought Wind Mobility s Italian unit to expand geographically. By March, Tier had acquired Fantasmo to bring the startup s camera-based scooter parking validation technology in-house, as well as Spin from Ford, marking the operator s entrance into the North American market and making it the largest operator in the world. All of those deals, aside from Ford, were likely primarily stock deals, meaning Tier didn t necessarily have to shell out cash for them, according to industry experts.\u201cWe have moved away from the strong focus we had on rapid growth and geographic expansion that defined the first few years of the business, and towards ensuring an increased return on investment for our current footprint,\u201d wrote Leuschner in his letter to staff, noting that Tier had been transparent about three months ago with the team about the company s goals to accelerate its response to the current economic downturn and funding climate.\u00a0\u201cWe have also taken the decision to stop or pause specific projects and work streams that can t currently demonstrate a clear path to profitability, and we have shared these decisions with you as they have been made.\u201dTeam members who were laid off will have access to severance pay, employee support in finding their next role, including help with CV, LinkedIn and cover letter writing, access to the alumni page, mental health support for three months of leaving the business and the ability to keep all office equipment and laptops for permanent employees. Tier is also offering equity and dropping its one-year cliff on ESOP for everyone hired in the past year.The company told TechCrunch that after assessing certain projects and directions that Tier would have to reduce or stop, it then looked at which roles would be unnecessary as a result of those decisions. To keep the process fair and retain as many people as possible, Tier applied a social scoring formula to determine where to make cuts.\u201cDifferent countries have different requirements when it comes to this but often this takes into account things like tenure, age and whether an individual has dependents,\u201d Madeline Ash, strategic communications advisor at Tier told TechCrunch via email. \u201cOnce we had been through these two steps, we then also went through a process to skill match affected individuals against any open roles we have at Tier and Nextbike to see if these could be offered as an alternative to allow us to retain as many people as possible.\u201dThis story has been updated to include information from the open letter sent by CEO Lawrence Leuschner, as well as further details into how Tier made its decisions on whom to lay off.",

        "title": "SoftBank-backed Socar, South Korea s largest car-sharing startup, tumbles on market debut",
        "text": "Socar, South Korea s largest car-sharing startup, tumbled in its Seoul stock market debut Monday even after pricing shares below the bottom end of a marketed range.Shares of Socar rose 1.25% from its IPO price of 28,000 won ($21.10) in the initial minutes of the debut, before tumbling to 26,300 won and giving the firm a market cap of $642 million.Last week, Socar cut its targeted IPO offering to 102 billion won ($78.1 million), giving the car-sharing company a valuation of 966.5 billion won ($731 million) before the start of trading.Socar s debut comes amid a sluggish period in the IPO market in South Korea that has prompted a series of Korean companies to delay their listing plans.Analysts attributed the muted performance of Socar s debut day to an expensive valuation and slowdown in the IPO market that is reeling from the global economic downturn.Jaeuk Park, CEO of Socar, told TechCrunch earlier that the company was pushing ahead with its listing plans because it was confident in its performance and expected to generate both operating profits and net profits by the end of this year.Rather than waiting for the stock market to recover for a higher valuation for the next two to three years, he said, the Korean mobility startup prioritized investment in organic/inorganic growth with the IPO proceeds.\u201cFirst off, Socar s growth is faster than expected in the face of re-opening [after the COVID-19 pandemic],\u201d Park said. \u201cThe stock market is expected to be tough for the time being, but the mobility industry will grow rapidly that we can t miss this critical time; we will focus on accelerating mergers and acquisitions and investments in new businesses and technology.\u201dThe company plans to beef up its services and geographic expansion efforts via acquisitions to become a mobility super-app with the goal of posting 1 trillion won ($748 million) of revenue by 2025, up from 289 billion won last year, Park continued. It aims to reach 30% or more annual revenue growth by 2025, he added.Socar, the first and only unicorn mobility startup in South Korea, aims to become the first listed profitable unicorn company, Park noted.Socar, backed by SoftBank, and Korean strategic investor SK Inc., entered the unicorn club with roughly 183.2 billion won ($150 million) funding at a 1.3 trillion won (approximately $1 billion) in March from Lotte Rental, the rental car unit of South Korean Lotte Group. The startup raised a total of 379.7 billion won ($ 284.2million) since its inception in 2011 before its IPO.The company s major shareholders, including SoftBank, SK Inc., Lotte Rental and Altos Ventures, will hold their stake since they agreed to a lock-up period of up to six months.The 11-year-old firm, which started the car-sharing service with 100 rental cars in Jeju, now manages a fleet of more than 19,000 vehicles across the country, offering services, including car-sharing, car-hailing, electric bicycle rental, parking, vehicle management and vehicle maintenance. It will launch its transportation super-app later this year, providing all-in-one mobility services. Additionally, Socar is building an ecosystem for future mobility, including an autonomous driving platform, charging stations service for electric cars and micromobility.Park said in an interview that Socar wants to enter the Southeast Asia market with its new business, a fleet management system (FMS) B2B SaaS service that it plans to begin selling later in the fourth quarter of this year. Socar, based on its 19,000 vehicles, has built the FMS technology that uses data, such as vehicle location and surroundings to support effective monitoring and control systems, providing accurate information to drivers and management servers.\u201cFMS is different from car-sharing, which has been Socar s flagship business for the past ten years, and if stabilized, it is a B2B SaaS that guarantees a high-profit ratio,\u201d Park said.Socar claims that the company has captured about 80% of the market share in South Korea, with more than 11.4 million users and 1.4 million monthly active users this year.The Korean car-hailing company has set up Socar Malaysia, a 79% stake owned by SK Inc., and launched services in Malaysia in 2018 and Indonesia in 2020.Socar was founded in 2011 by Lee Jae-woong, who co-founded South Korea s largest internet portal operator Daum Communications; Daum merged into Kakao in 2014. Jaeuk Park, a serial entrepreneur, who founded VCNC, an operator messaging app for couples called Between, in 2011, sold VCNC to Socar in 2018. After the sale of VCNC, Park joined as Socar s chief strategy officer to lead Socar s ride-hailing business Tada and took on the chief executive officer role (CEO) in 2020 after Lee stepped down.Korean game maker Krafton acquired VCNC s messaging app unit in May 2021, while Viva Republica, a Korean financial super app Toss operator, bought a 60% stake in Tada, the ride-hailing business of VCNC, for an undisclosed amount in October last year.Meanwhile, South Korea s TMap Mobility, whose investors include Uber Technologies and SK Inc. s investment firm SK Square, said Monday it has raised $149.2 million (200 billion won) from strategic investor KB Bank. Another Korean car-hailing platform Kakao Mobility, which also had planned an IPO between 2022 and 2023, said last week it has terminated its sale talk with Korean private equity firm MBK Partners.",

        "text": "When Marc Andreessen announced that he was sinking $350 million of a16z investors  money into a new venture by WeWork co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann, plenty of jaws dropped. For one, there was the massive sum and equally massive valuation for a company that, as of today, owns a few thousand rental units.Then there were the claims that Flow could help solve inequality, anxiety, loneliness and a number of other social ills. Neumann s ideas for Flow, Andreessen said, are \u201cnot lacking in vision or ambition, but only projects with such lofty goals have a chance at changing the world.\u201dThat s idealistic rhetoric, even by the standards of Silicon Valley.Something didn t feel right to us. Yes, there was the Neumann factor. But there was something more. Neumann and Andreessen were trying to privatize the neighborhood. Here s why we think that s not such a great idea.Amanda Silberling: Venture capital won t save usThere are some problems that venture capital can solve. For example, I find it pretty great that I can get a ride home from a vetted stranger if I m out alone late at night and don t feel comfortable walking to the subway, then transferring to a bus to get home.But therein lies the crux of the problem: What if public transportation was simply just better? What if I didn t need to decide between dropping $25 on an Uber and walking 15 minutes to the subway, standing alone underground, riding the subway, getting out, waiting for the bus outside alone, then taking the bus home at midnight?By the same notion, Adam Neumann s Flow wants to solve what investor Marc Andreessen calls a housing crisis.",

First up? The incredible, inimitable Zack Whittaker.Who is Zack Whittaker? What do you do at TechCrunch?Hi, I m the security editor here, a.k.a. TechCrunch s Bearer of Bad News, and I oversee the security desk. We uncover and report the big cybersecurity news of the day \u2014 hacks, data breaches, nation-state attacks, surveillance, and national security \u2014 and how it affects you, and the wider tech scene.If you could snap your fingers and tell everyone in the world one thing about your beat, what would it be?Think of cybersecurity as an investment for something you hope never happens, like a breach of your personal data. It s better to get ahead of it now. Nowadays it s easier than it s ever been \u2014 and it s never too late to start. Invest a small amount of time on three simple steps that make it so much tougher for hackers to break into your accounts or steal your data: Use\u00a0a password manager, set up\u00a0two-factor authentication\u00a0everywhere you can, and keep your apps and devices up-to-date.Tell me about this anti-stalkerware tool you launched this weekBack in February, TechCrunch revealed that a network of\u00a0near-identical \u201cstalkerware\u201d apps share the same common security bug, which is spilling the private phone data of hundreds of thousands of Android device owners around the world. These malicious apps are planted by someone with access to your phone and designed to stay hidden, but silently steal a victim s phone data, like messages, photos, call logs, location and more. Months later, we obtained a leaked list of every single device that was compromised by these apps. The data didn t have enough information for us to identify or notify victims, so we built this lookup tool\u00a0to allow anyone to check if their device was compromised \u2014 and how to\u00a0remove the spyware, if it s safe to do so.Ugh. Okay. So someone grabs your phone, installs one of these sketchy apps while you re not paying attention, the app rips your private data for the installer to snoop around\u2026 meanwhile, the app is leaking a bunch of data to anyone who knows where to look. Does it seem like the folks behind the stalkerware apps have any intention of stopping?Not at all. The Vietnam-based group of developers behind the stalkerware network went to great lengths to keep their identities hidden (but not well enough). The number of compromised devices was growing daily, but with\u00a0no expectation of a fix, we published our investigation to help alert victims to the dangers of this spyware. Nobody in civil society should be subject to this kind of invasive surveillance without their knowledge or consent.Besides this tool (which is excellent!), what s your favorite post you ve written or thing you ve done with TC?In the four years I ve been here? That s tough! One I still think about often is\u00a0the inside story\u00a0of how two British security researchers in their early-20s helped to save the internet from\u00a0the fast-spreading WannaCry ransomware malware\u00a0in 2017, which spread around the world, locking up computers in NHS hospitals, shipping giants, and transport hubs, causing billions of dollars in damage. But when one of them found and registered a certain domain name in the malware s code, the attack stopped dead in its tracks. They found the malware s kill switch, making them overnight \u201caccidental\u201d heroes. But the only thing holding back another WannaCry outbreak was keeping the kill switch domain in their hands alive, despite efforts by bad actors to force it offline by overwhelming it with internet traffic. \u201cBeing responsible for this thing that s propping up the NHS? Fucking terrifying,\u201d one of the researchers told me at the time.",

        "text": "In a sign that the market for logistics and transportation tech isn t cooling (economic downturn be damned), HyperTrack, a startup offering APIs for freight order planning, assignment and tracking, today closed a $25 million Series A funding round. Led by Westbridge Capital with participation from Nexus Venture Partners, the round will be put toward expanding HyperTrack s engineering team and \u201cdoubling down\u201d on broader growth, CEO Kashyap Deorah told TechCrunch in an interview this month.As supply chain challenges endure, VCs view logistics startups \u2014 including HyperTrack \u2014 as a safe bet in choppy market waters. While investment slowed in early 2022 compared to 2021, startups developing transportation and logistics technologies still collected $14 billion in Q1 alone, according to PitchBook.\u201cThe pandemic significantly accelerated on-demand delivery, the growth of the gig economy and software automation. All three factors have served as tailwinds for HyperTrack s growth,\u201d Deorah told TechCrunch via email. \u201cTwo of the toughest challenges for technology leaders are hiring talent and optimizing cloud bills. Business demands speed-to-market while development roadmaps continue becoming delayed. APIs help technology teams to build their apps their own way with predictable time and cost.\u201dPrior to launching HyperTrack, Deorah co-founded blogging platform RightHalf.com and restaurant payments app Chalo (among other startups), which were acquired by Stratify and OpenTable, respectively. After spending a little over a year at OpenTable as GM of payments after the Chalo acquisition, Deorah says he was inspired to found HyperTrack due to the growing demand in the \u201con-demand\u201d economy (e.g., food and goods delivery services) for location and mapping tech.Image Credits: HyperTrack\u201cIn the early days of DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates, then called \u2018Uber-for-X,  I recognized the on-demand economy as the convergence of physical and digital commerce across multiple industries and regions,\u201d Deorah said. \u201cHyperTrack has witnessed too many enterprises building their own logistics tech solutions, especially for on-demand fulfillment by gig workers. Our APIs deliver a better solution, support and price predictability than hyperscalers.\u201dAs Deorah explains, traditionally, companies making on-demand deliveries have taken a \u201clinear approach\u201d to geocoding customers  addresses. (\u201cGeocoding\u201d refers to transforming a description of a location, like an address or place name, to geographic coordinates.) But the addresses aren t always accurate. A recent study found that the coordinates vary widely across commercial vendors, with one vendor accurately mapping addresses only 30% of the time.HyperTrack, by contrast, claims to use \u201cground truth\u201d delivery data \u2014 data from orders fulfilled and routes taken to destinations, for example \u2014 to compute address accuracy in addition to metrics like service time, route deviations and live driver locations. The platform loops this data back into AI systems to \u201ccontinuously\u201d improve delivery order planning and assignment, Deorah says \u2014 ideally preventing delayed orders, lowballed payments to drivers and wrong ETAs.To customers, HyperTrack offers software development kits and APIs specifically for logistics around the last mile, or the last leg of an order s journey. The toolkit allows companies to build workflows that help predict things like capacity utilization and per-order costs, plus capabilities like nearby search, geotags, geofences and \u201cflex routes\u201d in consumer and delivery driver apps.HyperTrack tackles a logistics roadblock that other vendors, including Google and Amazon, have long aimed to address, too, with their own solutions. For example, AWS  Amazon Location Service lets developers add location functionality like maps, routing and tracking to their apps, while Google s Last Mile Fleet Solution ships with APIs, SDKs and a backend service for mapping and routing functionality.But Deorah asserts that HyperTrack is one of the few offerings on the market that bridges mobile, cloud and maps for a per-order price. He takes aim at startups like Onfleet, Bringg (which became a unicorn last June) and Locus\u00a0as well, which he says only provide proprietary packaged apps as opposed to unbundled APIs and development kits.Cost is indeed a major challenge for logistics providers in last-mile delivery. According to Statista, more than half cite increasing delivery costs as their main challenge, followed by reliable order fulfillment and a lack of workers. Eighty-two percent of brands feel they need to improve their customers  last-mile experiences, a separate survey showed \u2014 in part by increasing delivery options and promoting sustainability.The stakes can be high. In 2021, a Florida trucking contractor contended that the U.S. Postal Service s reliance on dynamic route optimization software shorted it $110 million, forcing it to slash hundreds of jobs and opening it up to lawsuits. Amazon s cost-saving routing algorithm reportedly had drivers walking into traffic.Image Credits: HyperTrack\u201cBuilders of logistics technology can often become confused by the various route solvers, mapping platforms, cloud technologies and smartphone APIs they need to stitch together to build simple use cases \u2014 not to mention inflexible fleet management applications that confuse developers with their APIs,\u201d Deorah said. \u201c[Using HyperTrack,] logistics tech builders no longer need to develop for months with a team of engineers to build out the consumer and driver apps for mobile, live location tracking, operations dashboard and cloud infrastructure.\u201dUp against the formidable competition, HyperTrack appears to have fared well, with 3,000 apps using the platform, including technician firm Jobox and home services company Spiritzone. Deorah \u2014 who declined to reveal revenue numbers \u2014 claims that the platform is now coordinating 10 million orders per month across a fleet of 150,000 drivers.\u201cIn 2022 alone, HyperTrack has grown from 15 to 30 employees and we plan to grow to 40 within the next few months.\u201d Deorah said. \u201c[HyperTrack] has been a complex product to build, yet here we are with a great product and many production users, and it is time to now double down on growth.\u201dThe Series A tranche brings HyperTrack s total raised capital to $32 million.",

        "text": "Incredible Health, a U.S.-based job-matching platform which made nurses its first focus, has closed an $80 million Series B funding round and announced hitting a $1.65 billion unicorn valuation, billing itself as the highest valued \u201ctech-enabled\u201d career marketplace in the healthcare sector \u2014 a couple of (pandemic-struck) years after closing a $15 million Series A.The latest raise is led by Base10 Partners, with existing investors Andreessen Horowitz and Obvious Ventures also returning to back the startup. Other investors in the Series B include Incredible Health customer Kaiser Permanente; plus a roster of angels and funds including Workday CEO Chano Fernando; NBA Champion Andre Iguodala; Rethink Impact; Stardust Equity; and the D Amelio family, including TikTok personalities Charli and Dixie D Amelio, who joined the round via their 444 Capital Fund.Incredible Health said the new funding will go on supporting initiatives to help health systems and their employees manage surging patient care demand \u2014 including through optimizing hiring workflow with the use of machine learning technology (which it says will include \u201cscreening and matching\u201d) to increase process automation and personalization for both healthcare workers and employers; career support for nurses and healthcare workers, including around skills growth, education, mobility and relocation; and new features for its community hub for nurses, such as personalized advice and content ranking.\u00a0The startup is shooting to expand and scale its platform to 90% of the U.S. nurse workforce, and also is eyeing moving into catering to healthcare worker roles beyond nursing that have critical shortages. (For nurses, it says the critical shortage means the U.S. is on track to be 1 million nurses short by the end of 2023.)\u201cNurses are the backbone of the US healthcare system, and they deserve the well-staffed teams and tools to not only succeed but also feel fulfilled in their careers,\u201d said Iman Abuzeid M.D., CEO and co-founder, in a statement. \u201cOur model has met the moment and changed the paradigm for both nurses and healthcare providers in the most challenging time in U.S. healthcare. We re excited to accelerate our growth to affect even more change.\u201dIncredible Health is dubbing 2021 a \u201cmilestone\u201d year in performance, with the startup clocking up a more than 500% increase in revenue. It also says more than 10,000 nurses join its marketplace every week, and claims it s been able to reduce the average time to hire to 14 days from the industry standard of 82 days. On the employer side, it says it has signed up more than 60% of the \u201ctop-ranked\u201d hospitals in the U.S. \u2014 with around 600 hospitals using its platform for permanent staffing.Commenting on its Series B in a statement,\u00a0Jamison Hill, partner at Base10 Partners, added: \u201cIncredible Health is an exciting addition to the Advancement Initiative portfolio. The company s mission and support for nurses closely align with our values but what truly makes Incredible Health special is how the company has transformed the way health systems recruit talent and nurses find work. The company is solving an urgent need in healthcare and we re excited to be a part of its next stage of growth.\u201dFor more on Incredible Health s growth spurt, check out our recent Found podcast interview with\u00a0Abuzeid:Incredible Health CEO talks maintaining company culture through incredible growthIncredible Health s hiring platform for nurses gets $15M led by Andreessen Horowitz",

        "text": "If you ask me, climate tech investor Contrarian Ventures isn t so contrarian anymore.The five-year-old firm is targeting $100 million for its second seed-stage fund, and it s doing so smack in the middle of a climate-tech dealmaking boom. So, if anything, it s trendy.But when the seed-stage VC \u2014 a backer of e-bike maker Zoomo and solar data firm PVcase \u2014 debuted with a $13.6 million fund in 2017, its focus was \u201cobviously contrarian,\u201d founding partner Rokas Peciulaitis told TechCrunch, as the \u201cindustries in vogue at the time were AI and Fintech.\u201dThe launch also marked an unexpected pivot for Peciulaitis, who says he dove into the scene with \u201cliterally zero climate tech sector experience.\u201d He d recently left an inflation-trading job at Bank of America, where the work was \u201cnot fulfilling in the slightest,\u201d Peciulaitis said in a nod to the bank s reputation as a major funder of fossil fuels.In 2017, PitchBook recorded 578 climate tech deals globally, altogether worth $12.5 billion. The sector has since tripled in size, as climate change\u2013driven extreme weather events occupy evermore space in our collective consciousness. To that point: PitchBook tracked 1,130 climate tech deals globally in 2021, topping $44.8 billion in value. Climate tech is cool now, but Peciulaitis s Lithuania-based venture firm is sticking with its name anyways.Like any venture capital firm, Contrarian says that it stands out through its emphasis on \u201cdeveloping excellent relationships with founders.\u201d Materially, the firm invests in tech that could help decarbonize transportation, industrial processes, energy and buildings.Contrarian has completed 21 deals to date, and this year it expanded beyond Lithuania with new partners in Berlin and London. The firm backs emerging startups in Europe as well as Israel, but nowhere else in the Middle East. Currently, the firm does not invest in agriculture-related tech, though the category has a significant carbon footprint of its own.In an email, Contrarian said it counts London-based tech VC Molten Ventures among its limited partners. The firm declined to share a full list of its LPs, but stated that none of them were fossil fuel companies.",

        "title": "Emerge Career s tech-forward job training lets incarcerated folks hit the road on release",
        "text": "Reentering society after years in prison is difficult for many reasons, among which perhaps the most prosaic is simply that it s hard to get a job \u2014 and what training and transition programs exist are far from sufficient. Emerge Career hopes to change that with an improved in-facility training curriculum that prepares the soon-to-be-formerly-incarcerated for an in-demand job using a more modern method.The startup, itself about to emerge from Y Combinator s latest batch, was founded by two people who had been working on improving another shortcoming of the prison system: video calls. Ameelio, which I covered back in 2020, replaced aging proprietary video calling systems in prisons with ones based on a modern open source stack, saving money and making the whole operation simpler and better for everyone involved.\u201cHaving spent the last three years developing tech for prisons, we got a feel for the major challenges that are facing people post-release, particularly job and employment stuff,\u201d said Uzoma Orchingwa, co-founder of Ameelio and Emerge Career with his colleague Gabe Saruhashi. \u201cReentry and in-prison education is left up to very small and underfunded organizations, and workforce training post-release relies on typical brick-and-mortar schools, which obviously limits their reach and ability to scale.\u201dPrison calling systems attracted complaints from regulators and activists because they are exploitative and unethically run, but in this case it s more like even people with the best intentions were facing an uphill battle against entrenched methods and red tape.\u201cSo we felt the need to start a separate entity for upskilling formerly incarcerated people and using government money to do it,\u201d Orchingwa continued.To be clear, though, this isn t some new drain on state budgets.\u201cThere s already money for training, but it s under-utilized,\u201d explained Saruhashi. \u201cWith one state agency we re working with, they had money allocated but not enough training providers.\u201dThese providers tend to be local vocational schools and community colleges with very limited resources. While they can provide some training, they aren t versed in the prison and post-release ecosystem, which involves more bureaucracy and personal restrictions than the schools tend to be capable of handling.Ameelio has helped prison systems upgrade the standard of technology for inmates with its managed tablets and video calling, and some of that same tech is being leveraged here.Ameelio s free video calling service for inmates goes live at first facilities\u201cWe built an online-offline system, recognizing folks won t always have access to the internet. All the work can be done offline, and when they re online they can sync up \u2014 it s similar to Coursera,\u201d Orchingwa said. \u201cWe have an instructor who can support students virtually using the communication system; we work closely with the Ameelio system as well, to have office hours and support students  needs.\u201dOnce out, they can finish up the class using a mobile app that works in all the same ways. (They pointed out that the under-employed like the possibility of doing a bit of job training between gigs.)Emerge Career s founders (Gabe Saruhashi, far left, and Uzoma Orchingwa, far right) flank some of the first graduates from the program. Image Credits: Emerge CareerSaruhashi noted that the team s experience working as a vendor for corrections means they understand the environment in which their system will be used, like security limitations and on-site procedures. There are also ways of getting the required paperwork, identification and other personal and professional documents that are a logistical challenge unlikely to be taken on by a small local trade school.The first training program Emerge has been making available is a commercial trucking license. The trucking industry is approaching crisis with a shrinking population of workers and difficulty attracting new ones. The pay is good and the work is steady \u2014 perfect for someone trying to get back on their feet. Some prisons even have the simulators or trucks necessary for the hands-on part of the training. And demand for drivers is high enough that employers won t bat an eye at the prospect of hiring a formerly incarcerated person.Here s Trevon talking about how it went for him:Anyone who s worked with folks coming out of prison (I did, years ago) will have seen how much pressure is put on them, yet at the same time how much opportunity is denied to them. Someone like Trevon is a living testament that a little help goes a long way, not just for him individually but for the community and government, which he will now support rather than be supported by.It attracted the attention of legislators, who are always on the lookout for ways to add jobs (check), reduce recidivism (check) and tie budget line items to tangible results (check).\u201cThe transportation commissioner was actively looking for ways to get more people into the profession. So he gave money to the DMV to come to the prison and proctor tests, then post-release they go straight to our trucking partners,\u201d Orchingwa said.Image Credits: Emerge CareerNot that the business needs friends in high places to get things done \u2014 but someone in charge generally does have to notice in order to allocate the money to Emerge as a state vendor. If the model works, it benefits everyone. The company has signed over $2 million in LOIs and contracts starting in Connecticut and is in talks with three other states.\u201cThere s actually a surplus of funds, and regardless of your values or political leaning everyone sees a major need for this; there s a trucking shortage and a lot of folks are struggling and unemployed,\u201d he added.After showing their system works with trucking, the company plans to expand into manufacturing, healthcare and other industries where there are serious labor shortages. The obvious possibility of coding-based professions is on their radar, but the competitive job market in tech right now makes it more likely someone will face a 4-6 month application and interview process, not something a recently released person can afford. \u201cOur people need jobs right away,\u201d said Orchingwa.Emerge Career is organized as a public benefit corporation and is looking for like-minded investors as it finishes up its stint at Y Combinator.",

        "text": "Motional, the Aptiv-Hyundai joint venture that s working to commercialize autonomous driving technology, has launched its new all-electric IONIQ 5-based robotaxi for driverless ride-hail operations on the Lyft network in Las Vegas. The news follows years of collaboration between the two companies in Las Vegas.The launch of the IONIQs, which marks the turnover of Motional s fleet of BMW-based AVs, is right on schedule. Motional and Lyft said last November that they would aim to start transporting passengers using the Hyundai vehicles in the City of Sin by the second half of 2022, with a full-scale commercial launch set for 2023.Similar to Motional s autonomous ride-hailing service that the company launched with Via in February, riders will not be charged for autonomous Lyft rides \u2014 the companies are mutually focused on rider feedback, said a company spokesperson. The spokesperson also noted that Motional has a permit to conduct fully driverless testing anywhere in Nevada, and that Motional and Lyft will secure the appropriate permits to start conducting commercial rides in fully driverless vehicles ahead of the launch in 2023.The Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles has not responded to TechCrunch s requests for clarification on what permits those might be, but a spokesperson from the department previously told TechCrunch the state is working on drafting new legislation around AVs. Nevada s current legislation doesn t make a distinction between testing or operating AVs with a human safety operator onboard or without, nor does it include specific language around commercializing robotaxi or autonomous delivery.Motional did not share how many IONIQ 5s will be deployed in Las Vegas, but the company did say it will continue to expand its fleet over the course of 2022 as it gears up for its commercial launch next year.Any Lyft rider in Las Vegas can request a Motional AV, according to the spokesperson. There will be two vehicle operators present in the front seats \u2014 presumably one behind the steering wheel in case a human needs to take over, and one in the passenger seat to record data and observations. The service route is focused on high-traffic and popular destinations along the Vegas strip and will only be available during daytime hours, which is fair when one considers that not many AV systems are trained to spot and avoid drunk hooligans vomiting on the street.Customers who order a robotaxi ride can use the Lyft app to unlock the doors of the autonomous IONIQs. While inside the vehicle, riders can interact with an in-ride display that allows them to start the ride or contact customer support. Many of the features within the vehicles come from years of testing and rider feedback from over 100,000 rides over the last four years, according to Motional.Motional has said for a time that it plans to expand to other major U.S. cities after commercially launching in Las Vegas, but the company hasn t said which other cities it is targeting. Like 47 other companies, Motional has a permit to test its driverless technology in California, a state that has become a key battleground for companies like Cruise and Waymo. Indeed, in May, Motional began a delivery pilot with Uber Eats in Santa Monica, and in July the company expanded its autonomous testing in San Diego. However, Motional might look further afield for less competition. Late last year, Motional began increasing public road testing in its hometown of Boston, and in order to really stand out amongst the competition, putting an AV service on the icy streets of New England might be just the right challenge.",

        "text": "Lori Systems, an African on-demand logistics and trucking company digitizing haulage and providing shippers with solutions to manage their cargo and transporters, has raised a pre-Series B round in which Google participated along with other existing investors. Sources say the company raised at a slightly higher valuation than its last $110 million valuation in 2020.\u00a0This undisclosed investment is Google s third from the $50 million Africa Investment Fund targeted at the continent s early- and growth-stage startups, which the company CEO Sundar Pichai announced last October. The fund is part of Google s plan to invest $1 billion in \u201ctech-led initiatives\u201d over the next five years. The news also comes off the back of the launch of Google s first product development center on the continent, in Nairobi, Kenya, the city where Lori Systems first launched.Last December, Google announced its first investment in Ugandan super app SafeBoda. During the announcement, Nitin Gajria, the managing director of sub-Saharan Africa, said that the Africa Investment Fund wouldn t restrict itself to specific verticals or regions. \u201cWe are focusing on investments where we believe that Google could add value. If founders are building interesting products solving real challenges in Africa, that would fall squarely within our investment thesis,\u201d he added.\u00a0The following month, the fund participated in South African games publisher and studio Carry1st s $20 million Series A extension round led by a16z. With its most recent investment in Lori Systems, a Google spokesperson \u2014 when quizzed about the fund s investment strategy considering its investments have come from three different sectors \u2014 told TechCrunch that the Africa Investment Fund has an eye for startups that it has a strategic overlap in key verticals, including fintech, logistics, e-commerce and local language content.Image Credits: Lori SystemsIn Africa, more than $180 billion is spent annually on haulage, and logistics account for more than 70% of a product s price, according to reports. For comparison, it s 6% in the U.S. The influence of logistical operations on products leads to various problems for operators, from inconsistent pricing, which stems from a fragmented supply and demand market, to paper documentation and little or no access to financing. Companies like Lori solve such problems and reduce costs with their on-demand logistics and trucking marketplaces, which connect shippers to transportation, help them move cargo, extend working capital facilities and provide them with software to manage their operations. Lori, in a statement, said it has helped thousands of shippers and carriers move over $10 billion worth of cargo across the continent since launching in 2016.Google s Africa Investment Fund makes first investment in Uganda s SafeBodaThe TechCrunch Startup Battlefield Africa winner in 2017 is currently present in Kenya, Uganda and Nigeria. In 2019, we reported the firm s Series A round, which several publications quoted to be between $20-30 million, led by Imperial Logistics (recently acquired by Dubai Ports World). Lori has raised a total of $38.2 million, according to Crunchbase. Some of its competitors include Kobo360, Sendy and Sote.Given that its last raise was almost three years ago, I asked CEO Uche Ogboi why it took Lori, one of the most funded logistics companies on the continent, that long to obtain subsequent funding and why it opted for an extension instead of a new priced round. She stated that Lori has been focusing on growth, sustainability and a path to profitability since its last funding round. According to the chief executive, the company has significantly broadened its product range and now offers a \u201cfully digitized transport management platform,\u201d built in response to the pandemic, which disrupted trade flows of shippers and transporters. Its new products have tripled transaction volume, while its marketplace take rate has almost doubled, she said.\u00a0\u201cAt this stage in our journey, and in this current market, we made the strategic decision to extend our Series A rather than raise a Series B on unfavorable terms,\u201d Ogboi answered in an email response concerning the company s fundraising efforts and the current VC landscape. \u201cWe are excited by this opportunity to partner with Google and expect to reevaluate our investment options sometime in the first half of next year.\u201d Lori wants to use the new funds to scale new product lines and reach profitability, Jean-Claude Homawoo, co-founder and chief product officer added.\u00a0It couldn t be learned how much Google s Africa Investment Fund put into this round, just as with investments in Safeboda and Carry1st. Yet, it s noteworthy that the fund \u2014 which, according to its spokesperson doesn t intend to lead investments but \u201cpartner with top investors who have a regional presence and local knowledge\u201d \u2014 has primarily participated in extension deals via convertible notes.\u00a0\u201cAt Google, we understand the transformative power digitization can bring to the African continent. There is so much potential in the region, but it s only through innovation that this can be fully unlocked,\u201d commented Gajria on Google s participation. \u201cLori Systems is a great example of how technology can be scalable across Africa, and how, in turn, this can drive meaningful economic development.\u201da16z, Avenir and Google back South African mobile games publisher Carry1st in $20M round",

        "title": "Helbiz reports revenue increase but dwindling cash reserves",
        "text": "Helbiz started out as a shared micromobility company but has since expanded to include ghost kitchens, media streaming and, most recently, a taxi service. The company\u00a0reported its second-quarter earnings Monday after the bell. The startup was the first scooter operator to go public via the SPAC route, and many in the industry wish it wasn t so after consistently\u00a0meh earnings reports.Since Helbiz s public debut in August 2021, its earnings reports have shown a company that burns through dwindling cash reserves, doesn t pull in enough revenue to make up for its high costs of operations and keeps pivoting away from core operations into new, and sometimes strange, business units.While Helbiz s revenue has increased slightly quarter over quarter and year over year, Monday s report tells a similar story.Before we dig into the financials, a little context. In late June, Helbiz signed a letter of intent to buy Wheels, another shared micromobility operator,\u00a0by the end of the year. In the midst of this, there were multiple times when Helbiz employees in U.S. and Serbian offices had to wait for delayed payments. Sources told TechCrunch that aside from late paychecks, Helbiz is suffering from chronically late scooter shipments and a general lack of company structure.Despite lackluster earnings, Helbiz s stock is trading higher than its public market rival Bird, which also announced earnings today. Today, at $1.43 after hours, Helbiz is up 12.6%. That is largely attributable to Helbiz CEO Salvatore Palella s acquisition of 252,636 shares of the company at an average price of $3 \u2014 a transaction that is valued at $757,908. Also, that number is still a far cry from the $10.92 at which Helbiz opened.Helbiz s Q2 2022 FinancialsHelbiz closed out the second quarter with $4.4 million in revenue, which is up 46% from the same period last year and 33% from last quarter. Mobility, or shared micromobility rides, made up more than half of the second quarter s total revenue at $2.7 million, up from $1.6 million in Q1.Helbiz reported around 1.2 million rides in Q2, which is nearly double its Q1 rides, but only a slight increase YoY. Unlike Bird, Helbiz doesn t appear to report the number of vehicles it has on the ground, nor its rides per vehicle per day.The remaining $1.7 million in revenue came from \u201cthe incremental contribution from Media and Kitchen,\u201d said Helbiz chief financial officer Giulio Profumo in a statement.During Q3 2021, Helbiz launched Helbiz Live, a sports streaming platform that is currently showing Italy s Series B soccer, NCAA football and basketball, and MLB games. Helbiz expects to generate $6 million during the first Series B season, some of which must have already been realized in Q2 2022.Around the same time that Helbiz launched Live, it also introduced Helbiz Kitchen, a ghost kitchen delivery service. The company was coy about how much revenue the new service has brought in, but Kitchen apparently delivered something. Helbiz said in the first half of the year, revenue nearly doubled sequentially. Of course, doubled from zero isn t exactly a massive achievement.\u201cImportantly, growth was solid in our core mobility business and we are improving margins as we bring down mobility cost of revenue,\u201d said Profumo. \u201cEven with our cost-control focus, we are investing effectively and efficiently in talent, advertising, marketing, and R&D to sustain our pace of expansion.\u201dHelbiz s operating expenses did decrease slightly QoQ, but at $20.8 million, they nearly doubled YoY. Loss from operations was down at $16.4 million from $18 million in Q1, but Helbiz s net loss of $19.7 million is about flat QoQ.The company finished the quarter with $2.5 million in cash, which is up from $1 million last quarter, but way down from $21 million during the same period last year. Helbiz had to raise $10 million this quarter via a new issue of convertible notes. In July and August, Helbiz also raised another $5 million to fund its \u201cmultiple growth opportunities,\u201d according to Profumo.The first half of the year saw Helbiz use about $4.7 million in cash to fund its micromobility operations. The company paid $3.5 million to vehicle manufacturers as deposits for e-bikes, e-scooters and e-mopeds, vehicles that Helbiz expects to be delivered throughout the year. And while Helbiz s acquisition of Wheels will be mainly stock, Helbiz put down a $1 million deposit to enter into the letter of intent, and invested $100,000 in operating licenses, which it has categorized as intangible assets.\u201cLooking forward, we will deploy more vehicles, pursue more micro-mobility licenses, and drive expansion in Asia Pacific,\u201d said the CFO. Helbiz recently launched shared e-scooter operations in Australia and expanded its existing fleets in the U.S. and Italy.The company provided no guidance for the third quarter or the full year.Helbiz earns its name with punishing 2021 earnings",

        "title": "Your future shrimp meal could come from Atarraya s farming technology",
        "text": "Atarraya, creator of Shrimpbox, a sustainable \u201cplug-and-play\u201d shrimp farming technology, is swimming to the surface after being in stealth mode since 2019. The Mexico City-based company emerges with new funding, $3.9 million in Series A dollars, and a new U.S. headquarters in Indianapolis.The company is claiming this is the \u201cworld s first\u201d technology of its kind, and Daniel Russek, founder and CEO of Atarraya, told TechCrunch that Shrimpbox was an idea he got after college in 2005 when he started with a non-government organization working with fishing communities.That grew into aquaculture farming technology with Russek and his team creating a startup company around it called Maricultura Vigas. That company mainly focused on the biotechnology aspects of aquaculture, including the challenge of raising shrimp in a closed loop system.\u201cWe wanted to make the shrimp business more sustainable and more efficient without destroying the environment,\u201d Russek said. \u201cWe decided to take a bet on the technology and became a startup. We raised some money, got some grants from the Mexican government.\u201dHowever, in 2019, the company realized that the challenge was a bit bigger than the founders previously anticipated. In addition to biotech, Russek felt there also needed to be software and automation components. So they created Atarraya, a U.S.-based company tasked with the challenge of making the shrimp farming technology sustainable and more affordable.A Shrimpbox farm system enables farmers to become vertical aquaculture farming operations. This includes cargo containers that can be located even in landlocked areas and moved accordingly to suit production needs.The three-pronged technology includes biofloc technology, which creates an ideal environment to protect shrimp from disease and so they can grow without the need for antibiotics or harsh chemicals and with minimal need for water discharge. Then there is the software aspect that enables remote operation management of the production and workflow mapped out with data so that it is easier to train and perform the farming tasks. Finally, artificial intelligence-powered automation and engineering components are designed to remote-monitor the water quality, regulate temperature and oxygenation and feed the shrimp.\u201cThis technology is basically everything in a hyper modular solution,\u201d Russek said. \u201cThe idea is that we can manufacture Shrimpbox anywhere in the world that is ready to use with plug-and-play and can be moved around efficiently using an intermodal transportation system.\u201dAtarraya s Shrimpbox aims to sustainably grow shrimp. Image Credits: AtarrayaCellMEAT, a South Korean lab-grown shrimp producer, bags $8.1M Series A funding\u00a0\u00a0Now armed with $3.9 million in Series A angel investment, the first Shrimpbox prototypes are currently being assembled in Guapinole, Oaxaca, Mexico and a farm for training and demo purposes is expected to open later this year in partnership with the Indiana Economic Development Corp.The funding was led by Jeffrey Horing and a group of angel investors, including Mark K. Gormley, Geoffrey Kalish, Robert Stavis and Robert Goodman. This brings Atarraya s total funding to $10 million to date, Russek said.The company grew its Mexican business 5x between 2020 and 2021. Russek expects Atarraya to begin an early adopter program in 2023 and will start scaling in the second half of the year.\u201cThat growth has enabled us now to be in a very strong position to make an impact in the industry,\u201d he added. \u201cOur goal is to create a new farming industry in the United States and to create infrastructure and technology that is as easy to use as a laundry machine so that anybody can become a shrimp farmer.\u201dWhile Atarraya is working with real shrimp, lab-grown and plant-based alternatives have also seen love from venture capital this year. For example, South Korea-based CellMEAT raised $8.1 million for lab-grown shrimp.What s beyond Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods in the future of food?",

However, while the 128 million trips taken in 2021 is an improvement from 2020, people are still not riding at pre-pandemic levels.Other findings from the report include:\u2022 Electric-assist e-bikes thrived in 2021, with the number of trips increasing from 9.9 million to 18.8 million.\u2022 Trips on e-scooters accounted for 49% of total trips taken on shared micromobility.\u2022 About 37% of shared micromobility trips replaced a car trip, which has helped to offset 54 million pounds of CO2 emissions.\u2022 63% of riders said they used micromobility to connect to public transitScooting right along (plus ebikes)If Bladerunner s Rick Deckard rode an e-bike, it would look like the NIU SQi prototype.Hummingbird partnered with engineering firm Prodrive to create a plant-based e-bike called the flax Hummingbird.McKinsey released a report that shows investors have dumped $8.4 billion into shared micromobility companies.

However, this past week there was some movement that signals the direction and commitment Hyundai has for Boston Dynamics.The automaker is forming Boston Dynamics AI Institute, which aims to advance research in artificial intelligence and robotics, and will be funded with a roughly $400 million investment. The new institute will be headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts and led by Boston Dynamics founder Marc Raibert, who transitioned away from the CEO role at the end of 2019, leaving longtime COO Rob Playter to take the reins.Other deals that got my attention \u2026Autonomy, the vehicle subscription startup founded by Scott Painter, has ordered 23,000 electric vehicles from 17 automakers.

        "title": "7 investors discuss why edtech startups must go back to basics to survive",
        "text": "In retrospect, edtech s spotlight feels like a fever dream. In the early innings of the pandemic, top companies turned into unicorns seemingly overnight as Zoom school became an actual reality for millions across the world, and a frenzy of check-writing seized investors.Then, we slowly saw the spotlight focus and sharpen. The very companies building for any consumer who needed a better way to learn online began turning to stickier customers \u2014 enterprises \u2014 for more reliable sources of revenue. The companies that took their first venture capital during the craze decided to join forces with other well-capitalized competitors. And those that raised lots of cash in a short period of time have had to conduct significant rounds of layoffs due to the overhiring that followed.We re widening our lens, looking for more \u2014 and more diverse \u2014 investors to include in TechCrunch surveys, where we poll top professionals about trends and challenges in their industry.If you re an investor who d like to participate in future surveys, fill out this form.Which brings us to today \u2014 and tomorrow. To give TechCrunch+ readers a better understanding of what education investors are looking for today, seven leading venture capitalists in the category answered a series of questions about the sector s future.Here s who we surveyed: Ashley Bittner and Kate Ballinger, Firework VenturesJan Lynn-Matern, founder and partner, Emerge EducationMalvika Bhagwat and Kriti Bansal, Owl VenturesJomayra Herrera, partner, Reach CapitalRebecca Kaden, general partner, Union Square VenturesI ll be honest, the diversity of the answers surprised me \u2014 ranging from how climate and workforce mobility are edtech s next opportunities to how the departure of tourist VCs is playing out differently depending on company stages. The tone also felt balanced: Many admitted that things have changed, but opportunity continues to exist. Like everything these days, the vibe is nuanced.Reach Capital s Jomayra Herrera encapsulated the changing landscape well:The deal pace has definitely slowed down in 2022 across most sectors. For context, we were closing a transaction every four days last year, and that has significantly dropped this year given the market conditions. I would say the past few years have been more of an anomaly, and we are getting back to a more sustainable pace.Emerge Education s Jan Lynn-Matern, meanwhile, was quick to point out that edtech investment in Europe is growing despite the slowdown in the United States \u2014 the sector has secured $1.4 billion in Europe thus far in 2022, 40% more than a year earlier, reports say).Investors are preparing for a time of going heads down, helping their existing portfolio companies that want to prioritize internal growth instead of raising more capital and rethinking their metrics of success. But that s all I m giving away now; read the entire survey to see where investors are finding hope, what is no longer venture-backable and what wave of edtech innovation they think we re in today.Ashley Bittner and Kate Ballinger, Firework VenturesThe early innings of the pandemic netted edtech massive investments of more than $10 billion in venture capital investment globally in 2020 and $20 billion in 2021. But the sector is now facing a downturn. How has this affected your edtech portfolio s ability to grow, and how are you changing strategy? It is important to acknowledge that this slowdown looks different from past downturns like the Great Recession. We have not seen a sharp increase in unemployment \u2014 as of May 2022, unemployment was just 3.6%, compared to 5% at the start and 10% at its peak during the 2008 recession \u2014 largely due to the tight labor market that emerged from the pandemic and the Great Resignation. We still see job openings and turnover at record highs, and many companies are not planning to cut back on hiring, let alone turn to layoffs.These differences are reflected in the experience of our portfolio companies, many of whom sell into HR and learning and development. In fact, one of our companies had their best quarter on record in Q2.When it comes to workforce learning, we believe companies are taking a different approach than they did in 2008. During the Great Recession, 1.5 million U.S. workers were laid off across over 8,000 mass layoff events. In an effort to further reduce spending, companies were quick to cut costs in areas like learning and development, which, at the time, were considered less essential.We now know that decisions like these may have significantly contributed to the massive skills shortage we face today.Over the past decade, many companies have grown to realize that investing in your workforce is essential to the success of the business \u2014 over half of companies facing skills gaps believe internal skill building is the most effective response, compared to one-third who believe hiring is the most effective.Last year, we were price-disciplined and adhered to our investment strategy as we deployed capital, bringing many of the valuations we re seeing today in line with our existing philosophy and expectations.The pandemic s spotlight on edtech led a slew of generalist investors to start looking at the sector and pouring money into it. This impacted the kinds of startups that got funding and the total capital in the market. Has edtech seen a slowing of the \u201ctourism\u201d from generalist founders and investors? If yes, what is the impact of a more focused sector?We believe that category expertise is particularly important at the seed and Series A stages. Category expertise is key for an investor to identify product-market fit in the context of the nuances of the sector. We believe there is space for generalist investors to continue investing in the category at the later stages, once product-market fit has been achieved and a company shifts its focus toward scaling.Edtech activity feels quieter. Is your deal cadence where you expected it to be one year ago? And are the pace of edtech exits today in line with your prior thinking? Our deal cadence remains unchanged. Firework leads investments primarily at the Series A stage, a strategy that is more concentrated by design (and likely not as adversely impacted by a downturn as other models). We build relationships with founders over time, developing conviction in them, their team and the company before investing.This approach allowed us to avoid the investing frenzy of last year. It also means we are not feeling a slowdown in deal cadence this year. We are seeing a lot of companies looking to raise money and have continued to spend time building relationships with impressive entrepreneurs.How did the pandemic change your perception of what makes an interesting edtech company? How has that held up when deciding what is considered impressive versus normal growth?The pandemic has not necessarily changed our thesis but has accelerated many of its underlying trends. We saw millions of people move to remote work and learning overnight, opening up massive opportunities around remote and distributed training.The economic recovery from the pandemic has been one of the most unequal in history, with a large number of women and other marginalized groups leaving the workforce altogether. This has only further emphasized the need to build solutions, in edtech and beyond, that are working to close these opportunity gaps.As a Series A investor, we often look at companies with high growth rates. While strong growth is important, we are focused on ensuring that growth is durable over time. For example, a company could have achieved tremendous growth during the pandemic by tapping into COVID relief funds, but this source of funding may not be stable enough to sustain them for years to come.What is no longer a venture-backable business model, in your view, in edtech? We do not have a prediction about any one business model no longer being venture-backable. We continue to look for founders with a high capacity for growth, both personally and for their business, in exciting market opportunities.What fraction of your companies plan to raise this year? What percent are raising extension rounds and how common is that proving in edtech?We do not have companies raising extensions of their previous rounds, but we have heard from many founders who are. This move toward extension rounds illustrates a level-setting of expectations from founders around fundraising in the current economic environment.Understanding the venture context is incredibly important for founders looking to raise capital. We work closely with our portfolio companies ahead of when they are looking to raise their next round to help them understand this context (along with their specific company context) and set goals for the fundraise accordingly.Some edtech unicorns have had to cut staff to deal with the looming recession and the downturn. What should edtech companies do to optimize their runway for the next couple of years?",

        "text": "Arrival, the U.K.-based commercial EV startup turned publicly traded company, has lowered its delivery plans from 400 vehicles to 20 as it postpones development of its battery-electric buses and shifts gears to focus on vans.The company, which reported Thursday widening losses for the second quarter, said it no longer expects to generate revenue in 2022.\u201cWe are switching from the mode where we have two products, two shifts and two micro factories to the mode where it s one factory, one shift, one product,\u201d CEO Denis Sverdlov said during a call with analysts. \u201cWe believe that this opportunity to switch gives us better chances to be successful.\u201dSverdlov s comments confirm a Financial Times report last week citing unnamed sources that the company was shelving its electric bus and an electric vehicle designed in partnership with Uber and plans to focus on the van. Arrival revealed in May 2022 at a TechCrunch event the first prototype of its purpose-built electric vehicle for ride hailing.The company said the \u201cArrival Car\u201d is no longer a lead vehicle with the significant majority of management and engineering time being spent on the van. \u201cThe car is part of our longer term vision and will join the van and bus to provide cities with the multi-modal zero-emission transportation ecosystem that they require in order to meet their sustainability goals over the coming years,\u201d a company spokesperson said in an emailed a statement.For the second quarter, Arrival reported a loss of $89.6 million, compared with a loss of $56.2 million in the second quarter of 2021. The adjusted EBITDA loss for the period was $76.2 million, compared with a $41.2 million loss during the same period last year.The company has faced several delays since going public in March 2021 through a $660 million SPAC deal with CIIG Merger. Production delays triggered a class-action lawsuit against the company, which now plans to open its Charlotte, North Carolina, factory next year. \u00a0\u00a0Arrival had initially expected to deliver between 400 and 600 vehicles in 2022.\u201cOriginally we wanted to make many shifts to push the volumes for the end of the year,\u201d Svedlov said. \u201cWe decided that strategically it s better for us to spend cash, be much more careful and focus on delivering first vehicles in perfect condition to our customers, and then scale from that point.\u201dLast month, Arrival signaled plans to slash costs and cut as much as 30% of its workforce in an effort to protect the business from a challenging economic environment while meeting its production targets. The plan was designed to allow the company to meet its targets through late 2023 using the $500 million of cash it has on hard, the company said at the time.Arrival ended the second quarter with about $513 million of cash and cash equivalents and said it began restructuring the business to reduce costs. The company also is aiming to raise money through a $300 million at-the-market offering.Updated with a comment from Arrival.",

        "text": "Since the start of the pandemic, the global supply chain has undergone \u2014 and is undergoing \u2014 immense strain. As of late last month, there were more than 300 ships in China waiting to load up and head to the U.S., Cargomatic s Weston LaBar told NPR s Marketplace. Meanwhile, warehouse space remains at a premium. Experts expect that it ll be years before the chaos subsides, unless something changes.Automation can t overcome these problems \u2014 but it can help. At least, that s the assertion of King Alandy Dy, the founder of Expedock, which uses AI to digitize freight paperwork and categorize it into existing logistics management tools. In a show of investor confidence, Expedock today closed a $13.5 million Series A funding round from Insight Partners, WIN, Decent Capital, Fourth Realm, Neo and Pear, which brings the startup s total raised to $17.5 million.\u201cThe entire global supply chain today is run by semistructured information and siloed data systems. Because of this, these supply chain businesses have extremely limited visibility on their own businesses due to the lack of access to their own data,\u201d Alandy Dy told TechCrunch in an email Q&A. \u201c[With Expedock], instead of determining margin on shipments or landed costs on a quarterly basis, customers can see everything live.\u201dPrior to co-founding Expedock, Alandy Dy started Applica, a software-as-a-services platform for managing college admissions. He later joined Intuit as a data connections and machine learning specialist, where he built a dashboard to show \u201chigh-value\u201d requests being made by users to drive bank account integrations.\u201cJeff Tan, our COO, comes from a family of freight forwarders,\u201d Alandy Dy said. \u201cWe ve been running international shipments since we were 15 \u2014 Tan and I were familiar with the manual work necessary to process international shipments. [To launch Expedock], I also brought in Rui Aguiar, our CTO and my seatmate in our first computer science class.\u201dImage Credits: ExpedockExpedock extracts invoices from shipping account statements in PDFs and emails, creating payable invoices and auditing them against accruals of existing shipments. The platform attempts to reconcile documents with third-party websites and internal systems and spotlight exceptions as they come up, sending the data to transportation management and enterprise resource planning systems.Alandy Dy says that Expedock uses the documents and associated shipment data, augmented by public data and \u201cAI-generated sources,\u201d to train its invoice-extracting systems. AI-powered features on the roadmap include fraud detection in supply chain payments as well as predicting vendor churn and margins.It s this application of AI that piqued the interest of Insight Partner s Connor Guess, he told TechCrunch via email. \u201cWith their innovative use of AI to automate the time-consuming documentation process, Expedock is modernizing freight forwarding and reducing inefficiencies to keep goods moving,\u201d said Guess, who s joining Expedock s board of directors. \u201cInsight s bread and butter is software companies driving transformative change in their industries, and that s exactly what Expedock is doing in the international freight industry.\u201dWhile there s lots of competition in the freight logistics tech space \u2014 see Vector.ai and 7bridges, for starters \u2014 Alandy Dy says that Expedock is currently working with some of the largest brands in the global supply chain, including Wayfair, ClearFreight and Ascent. When asked, he said he s not concerned about global economic headwinds, given that business has remained steady despite the doom-and-gloom headlines.Expedock also has the advantage of occupying a sector \u2014 transportation and logistics \u2014 that s still seeing a disproportionately high level of investment activity. Supply chain woes have been a windfall for some startups in the segment, with M&A activity for all venture-backed supply-chain and logistics startups reaching $2.7 billion in the U.S. in 2021, a 68% increase from 2019, according to McKinsey.\u201cConsidering the explosive consumption of physical goods and heavier levels of international trade, Expedock has seen its customers moving more and more every single week,\u201d Alandy Dy said. \u201cOverall, the general sentiment in the space is that there aren t enough people to move the goods demanded by the market. There are certainly ups and downs, here, but capacity to move freight is much lower than the demand, so even if this demand continues to drop, we re still at around 8x the cost of international logistics from before the pandemic.\u201dBeyond product development, Alandy Dy says that Expedock s focus in the near term will be hiring engineers and account executives and growing the number of integrations on the platform. Expedock employs 13 people today \u2014 a number Alandy Dy expects will reach 40 by year-end 2022.",

        "title": "The Station: Rounding up the Tesla Cyber Roundup, a Waymo change up and the mysterious disappearance of Bolt Mobility",
        "text": "The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation.\u00a0Sign up here \u2014 just click The Station \u2014 to receive it every weekend in your inbox.Welcome back to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. This week it s a dual-hosted event with transportation editor Kirsten Korosec and transportation reporter Rebecca Bellan steering the ship, er, car. One story that deserves your attention is the mystery around Bolt Mobility.Bolt Mobility appears to have ceased operations and vanished into the ether, leaving behind dead vehicles and unanswered calls in at least eight U.S. markets.\u00a0Representatives from affected cities told TechCrunch they haven t been able to get ahold of anyone from Bolt, including the company s CEO Ignacio Tzoumas. In addition to reaching out to as many cities where Bolt had, until recently, been running a service, Rebecca also made multiple attempts to reach Bolt staff members and its investors \u2014 to no avail. Even Bolt s customer service line doesn t appear to be staffed.\u00a0It s all very mysterious. Bolt had appeared to be on an upward trajectory last year after acquiring the assets of Last Mile Holdings, which opened 48 new markets to the micromobility operator. The company also had some recent undisclosed investment, which ostensibly could have tided Bolt over long enough to, at the very least, remove its vehicles from the streets and properly dispose of or recycle them.\u00a0So what gives? We re still working that one out, but Alex Wilhelm and Annie Saunders have been pondering the effect that asset depreciation can have on startups like Bolt. For example, we ve seen with Bird just how lackluster the economics of running shared scooter companies are just from an operations perspective. Wilhelm and Saunders write:When the cost of vehicle depreciation was factored into its business\u2026it was hugely gross-margin-negative. So, its cash was going into not only operations but funding a huge fleet of gear. Gear that it had to design, manufacture, ship and market in an effort to make its money back. It never quite worked.\u00a0Alrighty then, onward!You can also email us at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com and rebecca.techcrunch@gmail.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You also can send a direct message to @kirstenkorosec.Micromobbin A word on safety. I keep seeing reports of emergency room visits for e-scooter riders. My initial reaction to news of e-scooter accidents was to blame cars for ruling the roads and cities for not providing enough safe bike lanes. However, there s also space to push micromobility companies to provide more protections.\u00a0In Denver, a rider simply reached up to adjust her glasses and before she knew it was flatlined with a head injury. An easy mistake to make, and one I can see myself making.Sturdier scooters and helmets offered with all shared micromobility vehicles could make an appreciable difference. I live in Auckland, where Neuron, Beam and Lime run a service. Neuron and Beam both have helmets attached to their scooters, so it can be done, whereas Lime, for whatever reason, does not. In fact, most scooter companies don t offer helmets. Instead, they promise to improve safety by spending lord-knows-how-much on computer vision technology to keep riders off sidewalks.\u00a0In other news\u2026Electric moped growth is predicted to double in Asia.\u00a0Google Maps is now providing route information updates to cyclists.\u00a0India is finalizing its national battery swap program for two- and three-wheeled EVs.\u00a0Joyride, a micromobility software provider, has opened up a hardware marketplace to help operators build up their fleets.\u2014 Rebecca BellanA little birdWe hear things and we share the tidbits that we can verify.There is some executive movement over in Waymo land. Dan Chu, Waymo s chief product officer, has left the Alphabet subsidiary, according to a few folks in the know (and later confirmed by Waymo). Chu had been at Waymo for eight years and 14 years at Alphabet.Waymo confirmed Chu s departure and said he was moving on to a new \u201cprofessional opportunity in the health tech industry.\u201d The company said Chu was staying on through mid-September \u201cto ensure a smooth transition.\u201d\u201cWe re grateful to Dan for his product leadership and vision, having helped us launch Waymo One, Waymo Via, and build a world-class Product team,\u201d the company said in a statement.It appears that Waymo already has a replacement in mind. Saswat Panigrahi, who joined Waymo in 2016 and was most recently vice president of strategy, product management and data science, is taking the CPO spot.\u201cPanigrahi has been with Waymo for almost six years in a variety of product leadership roles, managing our engineering and commercial roadmaps across ride hailing, long haul trucking and local delivery,\u201d the statement continued.During his time at Waymo, Panigrahi\u00a0has been a part of launching the first fully autonomous public commercial service in Phoenix and the start of fully autonomous operations in San Francisco, the company said, adding that prior to joining Waymo he was with Google for four years as senior product manager working on Chrome Browser, Chromebooks and Android.Deal of the weekLooks like there s a new micromobility SPAC on the market, and we re trying not to cringe. Galata Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company led by Callaway Capital with $146.6 million in trust, has announced plans to merge with Marti Technologies, a micromobility app in Turkey that operates a fleet of morew than 46,000 e-mopeds, e-bikes and e-scooters. Marti will use the funds from the IPO to strengthen its position in Turkey by deploying additional vehicles across existing and new modalities.\u00a0Given the performance of other micromobility companies that have gone public via SPAC \u2014 AKA Bird and Helbiz \u2014 it s actually surprising to see Marti decide to go public via the same route, particularly when so many other startups are shunning the public markets until things heat up again.\u00a0Other deals that got my attention \u2026Boatsetter,\u00a0the Airbnb of renting boats, secured a $38 million Series B round.Canyon Bikes is getting $30 million to fund its U.S. expansion from LeBron James, who apparently is an avid cyclist.Hyundai is considering acquiring the remaining stake in 42dot, a South Korea-based lidar-free autonomous mobility platform.\u00a0Mobiv Acquisition, a blank-check company led by Peter Bilitsch targeting the electric vehicle industry in Asia and Europe, raised $87 million in an IPO.Nexar, the Israeli dash cam data company, is acquiring Veniam, an IoT company that transfers data from cars to the cloud with its connected vehicle mesh network.\u00a0Nikola agreed to acquire Romeo Power in an all-stock $144 million deal, giving the company control over a key part of its supply chain.Orange EV raised $35 million in a round led by S2G Ventures and CCI to accelerate the adoption of electric yard trucks.\u00a0Ottonomy.IO, the autonomous robotics delivery startup, raised $3.3 million in a seed round led by Pi Ventures. The company has raised $4.9 million to date. Connetic Ventures and Branded Hospitality Ventures and Sangeet Kumar, founder and CEO of Addverb Technologies, also joined this round.River, a Bangalore-based startup that makes electric two-wheelers, has closed an $11 million Series A. The round, which was led by Chris Sacca s Lowercarbon Capital in participation with Toyota Ventures and existing investors Maniv Mobility and Trucks VC, will help the young company set up a manufacturing facility and get its first product ready for sale by early 2023. River has the potential to be a leader in the Indian market, given the government s plans to push EV sales penetration of two-wheelers up to 80% by 2030.Notable reads and other tidbitsAutonomous vehiclesArgo AI launched a safety advisory council, an external group of safety experts to help the company advance its autonomous mission and build trust with the public. The council is stacked with some of the best in safety, including former National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt, TransSafe Consulting CEO Annette Sandberg, who once led the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and Christopher Doss, the senior managing director of cybersecurity at Ankura and former Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Aurora Innovation announced a multiphase commercial pilot to haul freight for Schneider National s customers in Texas.\u00a0Embark conducted a public demo to show how its autonomous trucks would interact with emergency vehicles and law enforcement in Texas.\u00a0Innoviz will be supplying its lidar sensors and perception software to all Volkswagen group vehicles with automated driving capabilities.\u00a0Pony.ai is suing two former employees who left to start their own autonomous trucking companies over alleged trade secret infringement.\u00a0Electric vehiclesGreenPower Motor Company announced the first delivery of its EV Star Cab and Chassis to Workhorse for the production of the latter s van line which is expected to enter production later this year.\u00a0Lamborghini wants to wait and see what kinds of policies the European Union will enforce on ICE vehicles before deciding to go all in on EVs.\u00a0Tesla shareholders approved a three-to-one stock split, but they rejected proposals to improve annual reporting on things like racial, sexual and gender harassment and discrimination, lobbying, water risk and use of child labor in the supply chain. Check out other key takeaways from Tesla s Cyber Roundup.\u00a0Speaking of Tesla, Mark Harris, who also writes for TechCrunch, just wrapped up a series on Tesla data for IEEE Spectrum. The Radical Scope of Tesla s Data Hoard, Tesla s Autopilot Depends on a Deluge of Data and Who Actually Owns Tesla s Data? Check it out.And the final item on the Tesla front, the California DMV has accused Tesla of falsely advertising its FSD beta software, reported the LA Times.Volkswagen said it would offer a cheaper version of its ID.4 electric compact SUV, with a smaller battery pack, that starts at $37,495 before federal tax credits (and not including the $1,295 destination fee).Xpeng s July sales results are in. The Chinese EV company sold 11,524 Smart EVs. While that s up 43% YoY, it s down from 15,295 vehicles delivered in June. The breakdown looks like: 6,397 P7 sports sedans, 3,608 P5 smart family sedans and 1,519 G3i smart compact SUVs. In August, Xpeng will accept reservations for its new G9 SUV followed by an official launch in September.EarningsAurora Innovation pushed back the deployment timeline of its commercial autonomous trucking platform. The company closed out Q2 with \u201ccollaboration revenue,\u201d which isn t actually revenue, of $20.7 million and a massive net loss of $1.2 billion.Fisker said it now has more than 56,000 reservations for the Ocean electric SUV, of which it has 55 prototypes built, and is on track to start production November 17. Despite the promise of revenue in the future, the luxury EV startup closed the second quarter with pretty much no revenue to speak of, a loss per share of $0.36 and a net loss of $106 million, which is down from the $122.1 million loss reported in Q1.\u00a0Lordstown Motors reported its first quarterly operating profit of $61.3 million. The embattled EV company still hasn t delivered any vehicles, so these gains are largely related to the sale of its Ohio factory to Foxconn. The company reaffirmed plans to begin commercial production of its first vehicle this quarter and roll out customer deliveries by the end of 2022.\u00a0Lucid Motors slashed its annual production guidance in half due to supply chain and logistics issues. The luxury EV company had originally planned to produce 20,000 Air sedans this year. In February, that number got cut down to 12,000 to 14,000. This week, Lucid said it could maybe deliver 6,000 to 7,000. The company reported $97.3 million in revenue for the second quarter, missing analyst expectations, and an adjusted net loss of $414 million.Lyft reported record earnings in the second quarter, with revenues of $990.7 million. Net loss for the quarter was $377.2 million. The company s shares were up 4.07% in after-hours trading, after the company convinced investors it was able to offset the costs of increased investments in drivers by cost-cutting internally and taking advantage of a post-COVID travel boom.Nikola reported $18.1 million in revenues on deliveries of 48 Tre BEVs and four mobile charging trailers. The EV maker, which is trying to move past its tumultuous and troubled past, closed out the quarter with a net loss of $173 million and total liquidity of $841.8 million. The company also announced the locations of three California hydrogen stations to help it scale up its long-term hydrogen distribution solutions.\u00a0TuSimple reported a $2.6 million revenue, which was up 73% YoY but missed Wall Street expectations drastically. The self-driving trucking company used the earnings call to address a recent crash of one of its test trucks, in which the truck suddenly veered across the I-10 highway in Tuscon and slammed into a concrete barricade.\u00a0\u00a0Uber came out the gate swinging with its Q2 earnings, during which the company reported revenues of $8.1 billion, up 105% from last year. Gross bookings rose 33% to $29.1 billion from $21.9 billion a year ago. The company finished out the quarter with positive free cash flow, meaning it can now, finally, self-fund. Uber s shares were up 14.4% after the company reported earnings.\u00a0Another tidbit: Uber also sold its 7.8% stake in food delivery company Zomato for over $390 million.\u00a0Miscellaneous\u00a0General Motors will soon allow drivers to use Super Cruise on more than 400,000 miles of road in the U.S. and Canada, which will double the geographic access to the hands-free driver assistance system.GM Future Roads and Inrix are offering \u201cSafety View\u201d to transport planners nationwide. The product is a cloud-based application that provides transportation officials with critical insights using crash, vehicle, vulnerable road user and U.S. census data to help prioritize and measure how effective roadway safety projects are and what their impact on communities is.\u00a0The two entities also launched a research report that focuses on Washington, D.C. schools. They found more speeding, as well as crashes, to occur around low-income schools than high-income schools; traffic signs didn t have a large effect on speeding; and the built environment is a larger factor in vehicle speeds than signage or specific operating times of school zones.\u00a0NYC s daily subway ridership is still significantly below pre-pandemic levels, according to Observable, a data vis startup that worked with Microsoft and Oxford University to create a fun interactive of the data.\u00a0Uber Freight published a white paper that finds for commercializing autonomous trucking in the near-term, the hub-to-hub model is the most practical and economically feasible starting point. The white paper also found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that autonomous trucks will fill job gaps rather than replace human drivers.\u00a0UFODrive has launched its electric vehicle rental service in San Francisco. The European company offers both EV rentals and subscriptions, and plans to expand to Austin and New York this year, as well.\u00a0U.S. Department of Transportation and Energy announced that all 50 states, D.C. and Puerto Rico have submitted EV infrastructure deployment plans as required under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program under Biden s infrastructure bill. The plans will unlock the first round of $5 billion funding available over the next five years to help states build out a national charging network.\u00a0RidehailTechCrunch got some inside information into how the Lyft layoffs are shaping up since the company shut down its in-house rentals unit. A spoiler: Staff were given 30 days to find a new job within Lyft or be separated from the company, but many are jaded that they weren t simply placed into new roles and instead have to compete with outsiders.\u00a0Uber is testing adding train and coach travel to its app in the U.K. after a tie-up with Berlin-based multimodal travel platform Omio.",

        "title": "Armed with $19.5M, LiveEO plots a big data course between satellite geospatial information and industry",
        "text": "When it comes to geospatial and mapping data and how they are leveraged by organizations, satellites continue to play a critical role when it comes to sourcing raw information. Getting that raw data into a state that can be usable by enterprises, however, is a different story. Today, a Berlin-based startup called LiveEO, which has built a satellite analytics platform to do just that, has raised\u00a0\u20ac19 million ($19.5 million) on the back of strong demand for its tech from companies working in transportation and energy infrastructure.The rise of companies like LiveEO comes on the back of a period of rapid commercialization in infrastructure intended to be used in space, typified by companies like SpaceX but also others building, for example, a new wave of\u00a0satellites themselves. As with the larger opportunity in enterprise IT, big data players like LiveEO are essentially the second wave of that development: applications built leveraging that infrastructure.Daniel Seidel (left), who co-founded and co-leads LiveEO with Sven Przywarra (right). Image Credits: LiveEO (opens in a new window) under a CC BY 2.0 (opens in a new window) license.\u201cSomeone has to build applications for end users to really make it simple to use and integrate that data into processes,\u201d explained Daniel Seidel, who co-founded and co-leads LiveEO with Sven Przywarra. \u201cThat is what we are doing at scale.\u201dMMC Ventures is leading the investment, which is not tied to a specific round, and in addition to \u20ac17 million of venture capital, the round also includes backing from two public bodies, the European Commission and Investitionsbank Berlin. Previous backers Dieter von Holtzbrinck Ventures (DvH Ventures), Helen Ventures, Matterwave and motu ventures, and new backers Segenia Capital and Hannover Digital Investments (HDInv), are also participating. LiveEO had previously raised a \u20ac5.25 million Series A in 2021, and it said that in that time, it s tripled revenues with customers in five continents and more than doubled its headcount to about 100, with more than half of those engineers and data scientists.As a German company, LiveEO is one of a small but growing group of startups in Europe capitalizing on increasing interest in space among investors\u00a0in recent years, despite the wider pressures on tech finance. Relatively speaking, though, the sums are still modest compared with other areas of tech: LiveEO says that this \u20ac19 million round is one of the largest in earth observation tech in Europe. LiveEO is focused on enterprise, specifically industrial applications for its analytics \u2014 although\u00a0given the geopolitical landscape, and how that is bringing a new host of interested parties playing the part of financiers to foster its growth, it will be interesting to see how that develops.LiveEO s platform addresses a specific gap between space tech and enterprise data. Satellites are collectively producing more data about our world than ever before, covering not just physical objects in the most minute detail, but thermal progressions, how systems are moving and more.Ironically, a lot of that data is very locked up when it comes to enterprises using it: Given the fragmentation in the satellite industry itself, the data is not only often in very raw formats, but coming from multiple sources, too, so getting it into forms that can be integrated into existing IT systems and specifically (and more trickily) the IT systems that integrate with the infrastructure that is the building block of a lot of industrial deployments \u2014 let alone parsing it for insights \u2014 are all tall tasks, so much so that the opportunities of doing them often go unrealized.The core of the company s platform brings all this together, in what LiveEO describes as an \u201cinfrastructure monitoring suite powered by satellite imagery.\u201d This involves taking the earth observation data produced by satellites and applying AI to it to analyze it in the context of what LiveEO s industrial clients \u2014 which include major railway companies like Deutsche Bahn, or the energy company e.on \u2014 are seeking to understand better.That could include data on risks from vegetation on railways or other lines; ground deformation; or other physical movements or activities; and it also includes the ability for a LiveEO user to directly integrate this data to link up with its own IT management systems for its infrastructure, for example those that monitor systems to make sure they are working as they should. It also pitches its solution as greener: using satellites to source the kind of geographic data that these industrial applications need means no need to use on-the-ground teams and vehicles to source it in other ways.\u201cOne of the great advantages of satellite data is that we don t require hardware to be installed at the infrastructure itself,\u201d said Przywarra.That data, they believe, is also more complete: As Seidel describes it, the combination of terabytes of data from multiple sources means it is not just 3D, but \u201c4D\u201d \u2014 with thermal and other kinds of details available, \u201cis like the difference between using an image from a smartphone, and a high-end camera with high resolution.\u201dAll of this is also still a relatively new field, Przywarra added. \u201cPrior to Google Earth, satellite maps were only used by experts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe enable more non-experts to use satellite data. We make it accessible and usable.\u201dLead investor MMC is one of the more prominent deep tech investors in Europe, and it s notable that they re putting focus in this area as an opportunity.\u201cWe are excited to lead this round for\u00a0LiveEO\u00a0and it reflects MMC s continued focus on emerging datasets and companies that develop AI analytics to power core business decisions,\u201d said Andrei Dvornic, a principal at MMC Ventures, in a statement. \u201cLiveEO\u00a0offers a critical tool that paves the way for sustainable industry automation, and we wholeheartedly support the company s vision of leveraging satellite technologies, big data, and the latest developments in artificial intelligence to help companies adapt to the challenges posed by climate change.\u201dUpdated to correct that this is\u00a0not a Series B.",

        "title": "UAE aims to convert oil wealth into tech prowess",
        "text": "The Middle East has long been thought of as an oil region, but the United Arab Emirates aims to change this with an intense focus on growing the country s technology and startup scene.For the first half of 2022, the Middle East region brought in $1.73 billion in investments across 354 deals, up from more than $1.2 billion in the first half of 2021 \u2014 a 64% year over year growth. The UAE took in 46% of the total venture capital received in the Middle East and Africa in 2021, according to the country s Ministry of Economy.H.E. Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, United Arab Emirates minister of artificial intelligence. Image Credits: United Arab EmiratesThe UAE began focusing on its tech and startup hub goal in 2016 by establishing the Sharjah Research Technology and Innovation Park to incubate companies in a variety of industries, including water management, renewable energy, transportation, manufacturing and agriculture.TechCrunch highlighted some of the more recent technology activity coming out of the United Arab Emirates, including that the country was going to pour $800 million into a fund to invest in space initiatives, that the region is now home to the \u201cworld s largest vertical farm\u201d and a global\u00a0 investment in local proptech startup Huspy.In 2017, the UAE created an artificial intelligence ministry position, which it filled with H.E. Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, who had previously worked in the banking and telecommunications sectors.H.E. Al Olama recently spoke with me about the burgeoning Emerati startup and venture capital ecosystem, and the country s approaches to attracting U.S. VC investment. What follows are highlights from our conversation, lightly edited for clarity and length.TechCrunch: Is the UAE s venture capital presence fairly new?H.E. Al Olama: If you look at the geography, you will see that the UAE attracts over 50% of all venture capital investments of this whole region. That is interesting, but when you actually look at the size of the population, it becomes a lot more interesting because you re talking about a very high concentration of very high-quality talent, as well as an ecosystem that allows for thriving startups and startups that don t just get started but actually go through different scale up phases.In terms of venture capital and investment into the region, I saw it was over a billion dollars in the last year. Do you see that increasing this year or on par with last year?For the first half of this year, the investments have been much more than we expected. Of all the investments in the first six months, there has been $1.73 billion invested in the Middle East, out of which 37.2% were invested in the UAE. So it is actually quite substantial. If we look at the comparison from 2022 to 2021, January was 2.5 times as was February, and March was 1.5 times, April was 1.5 times, May was 1.4 times and June was 1.2 times. That is for the whole region. What you can see from that is the interest that the global investors are having in the region. And, the theory that the UAE is still getting the biggest portion of that compared to other countries in the region that have a bigger population or seemingly a bigger market size, shows that the snowball started rolling a few years back with the startups that we ve had and it s actually just getting bigger. I think we re just getting started.How have you been able to attract tech companies to the UAE?Being tax free is definitely one incentive, but the UAE today is also a financial hub for our region and one of the top financial hubs globally. There s a lot of capital here ready to be deployed. One great advantage is a lot of investors feel more comfortable investing in a company situated in the UAE because of the transparency of the court system. Government legislations are friendly to the private sector. It s an environment that allows people to be able to thrive because they do not feel marginalized or disadvantaged because they have a certain ethnicity or sex or nationality. It is known to be able to be a place where anyone from anywhere in the world can actually succeed. In addition, the infrastructure is also quite advanced in terms of the quality of the roads and penetration of smartphones \u2014 we have the highest smartphone penetration in the world.United Arab Emirates launches $820M fund to boost domestic space economyThe government has been rolling out a lot of different incentives over the years, including startup-friendly policies. If someone were to move to the UAE, what would they need to know?We looked at all of the different sectors that are supportive of the startup landscape and tried to put in incentives to ensure that people actually prefer something up in the UAE as opposed to anywhere else. In most countries, it s very, very hard to get a visa. If you are a talent and work specifically in a digital economy that we re very focused on, you can get a permanent residency or a long-term residency right off the bat. Another thing, you can start the company within a day. Third, there are a lot of different programs, for example, incubators and accelerators and government contracts that are very appealing.TC: How did the UAE s AI mandate come about, and what was your plan to get it started?We asked what are we really trying to decipher? What exactly is the potential for the UAE, whether it s positive potential or negative potential, and how can we ensure that we deploy AI effectively across the country in a way that improves quality of life. Quality of life is actually the main driver for AI. It s not economic gain, as it is in many countries. Second, it is hard to ensure that our policies or legislations actually give us an advantage with regards to the negative consequences of deploying AI, whether it s locally or globally. If AI goes wrong somewhere else, how do we ensure we are less likely to get burdened by it? Our motto from day one was building a responsible artificial intelligence nation that is useful for the current, but also for the future.Crop One, Emirate open \u2018world s largest vertical farm  in DubaiDo you expect the UAE to have challenges attracting U.S. talent and investment due the region being known for its human rights violations?The Middle East does have a reputation as being something of a \u2018tough neighborhood  for a wide range of reasons, from conflict to failures of governance. We do see the Emirates as differentiated, with a highly tolerant, multinational community consisting of people from over 195 nationalities living, working, learning and playing together in an atmosphere of peace, stability and security.Why has supporting startups and venture capital been such an important push for the region?A few reasons: First, if you look at our history, the UAE has always been a country of merchants and always looking to support business and unleash opportunities. The second thing is, we have been very adamant and very vocal about our ambition to diversify away from oil and that can be seen through investments in renewables and other parts of our economy, namely the digital economy, to ensure that we are competitive and comparative to advanced and developed countries from around the world. Finally, we are not a large country, so we will not be able to compete in certain sectors with other countries that have a cheaper cost of labor. But, if you look at the digital economy and sectors that are emerging right now, because of the advancement of technology, you re able to get incredible returns from talent that \u2014 even if they are quite expensive \u2014 are able to create output, and that is what we re actually aiming towards.The venture slowdown isn t coming \u2014 it s here",

        "title": "European EV rental startup UFODrive launches in San Francisco",
        "text": "UFODrive, a Europe-based electric vehicle rental company, landed in San Francisco on Thursday, marking the startup s expansion into the U.S.The startup, which gives users an easy and contact-free way of renting and subscribing to EVs, comes to California at a time when gas prices are still incredibly high, at $5.56. While that number has dropped in recent weeks, it s still cresting the national average. Combine that with an ongoing rental car shortage and a cultural zeitgeist that s embracing all things electric, and UFODrive has got itself a potentially winning product-market fit.\u00a0\u00a0UFODrive s U.S. launch follows the company s rapid growth in 16 cities across Europe, including London, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and Dublin, since its founding in 2018. The startup is also planning separate launches for New York and Austin in October.Other companies have cropped up around the world to provide a similar service. For example, Onto and imove provide monthly EV subscriptions in the U.K. and Norway, respectively. Where UFODrive differs is it offers a combination of classic daily or weekly rentals and monthly subscriptions. That said, the San Francisco launch will initially offer pure rentals.\u00a0Bookings can be made on UFODrive s app, where each customer is guided through the entire process \u2014 registration, identity verification, locating the vehicle, damage check, contract signature and driving away, according to Aidan McClean, UFODrive s CEO.\u00a0\u00a0Customers in the Bay Area can visit one of two vehicle bays in downtown San Francisco on either side of Market Street where they can then use the app to be granted keyless access to their vehicle.UFODrive worked with Inspiration, the EV asset financing firm that supplied New York-based Revel with its own set of Teslas for ride-hailing purposes, to get around 20 Tesla Model 3s and Model Ys on site for the launch. As the startup has done in Europe, UFODrive plans to lead with the dazzle of Tesla for the first locations and expand its range based on customer input and availability, according to McClean, who noted UFODrive is also looking forward to including Ford in that lineup.\u00a0In Europe, the fleet is predominantly made up of Tesla Model 3, Model S and Model Y, with Volkswagen ID.3 and ID.4, Hyundai Kona EV, Cupra Born, Polestar and others, said McClean.\u00a0A software platform designed to minimize EV angstCustomers can unlock rented electric vehicles via the UFODrive app.\u00a0Image Credits: UFODrive\u201cOne of our biggest concerns when we started UFODrive was making people comfortable using an EV and minimizing or removing anxiety throughout the rental \u2014 not just at pick-up,\u201d McClean told TechCrunch. \u201cFrom Day 1, our platform was built to identify issues before they happen. The team is notified if a customer hasn t completed any of the pick-up stages, fails to start the vehicle, is driving with a battery level below 30%, struggling to charge at a station, etc. In those cases, our team can proactively reach out to make sure the customer is OK if they haven t already reached out to us. As a result we have never had a range or charging issue in over 20 million kms driven.\u201dUFODrive s platform is also built to guide drivers to the exit of the bay, route them to the nearest charger and walk them through how to charge their vehicle. If a customer is having an issue, they can use the app to reach out 24/7 to one of the startup s customer service agents, who can remotely unlock or switch on a car, use cameras to check for unreported damage, do system updates, conduct identity checks and add drivers, McClean said.\u00a0It s this software platform that UFODrive is also hoping to sell as a SaaS product on the side, particularly to legacy rental companies to help them transition their renting models to EVs. In fact, car rental giant Hertz and travel-focused investment firm Certares led UFODrive s Series A in March, signaling the potential for larger partnerships in this space. Hertz seems particularly keen on making the switch to EVs \u2014 in October 2021, the company said it was investing in a fleet of Teslas and committed to offering the largest EV rental fleet in North America.How does the price compare?UFODrive hasn t posted its rates for San Francisco yet, but in Amsterdam, for example, renting a Tesla from the startup for the weekend could average out around $200, depending on the model. A quick search on Kayak, an aggregator for flights, hotels and car rentals, shows a similar price point for internal combustion engine vehicles, and that doesn t include the cost of gas or extra drivers.\u00a0UFODrive s rental prices include things like additional drivers, most tolls and free charging, according to McClean.\u00a0\u201cNo energy cost whatsoever for the rental whatever your mileage or distance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good deal before, but with current gas prices and price gouging by legacy rental businesses, it s really good.\u201dMcClean also pointed to UFODrive s loyalty reward program, which can help bring down the costs of rentals.\u201cIn order to achieve our goal of transitioning people to sustainable rental, we have to be competitive, but the EV model is inherently more efficient so we can be competitive and profitable,\u201d said McClean.While UFODrive is starting with a consumer push, the company does envision itself in the long-term being a solution for delivery drivers and last-mile transportation, as well, according to a company spokesperson.",

        "text": "Ottonomy.IO, a startup working on solving delivery problems using autonomous robots, has raised $3.3 million in a seed funding round as it looks to expand its market and deploy robots to existing customers.Led by Bengaluru-based Pi Ventures, the latest funding round included participation from Connetic Ventures and Branded Hospitality Ventures. Sangeet Kumar, founder and chief executive of Uttar Pradesh-based Addverb Technologies, also joined the round.Founded in late 2020 by Ritukar Vijay along with Pradyot Korupolu, Ashish Gupta and Hardik Sharma, New York-headquartered Ottonomy.IO develops robots that feature sensors, including 3D lidar sensors and cameras. The company, which employs about 25 people in the U.S. and India, also writes software and AI algorithms to power the sensors.\u201cOne of the most important problems which we are trying to solve with these autonomous delivery robots is around labor shortages,\u201d said Vijay, who serves as the chief executive of Ottonomy.IO, in an interaction with TechCrunch. He added that due to the labor shortages, there is a substantial increase in the hourly wages of laborers \u2014 to $18 to $45 per hour from $9 to $12 \u2014 in the U.S.\u201cSo, that s almost a 100% hike in hourly wages, making it very difficult for enterprise customers to provide the same services to the customers they were given earlier. And what happens at the end is that customers start paying more for deliveries.\u201dOttonomy.IO s autonomous robots help address the growing demand for last-mile deliveries and cater to emerging delivery requirements, including indoor and curbside deliveries. The latter is specifically a type of delivery in which the item is delivered to a place such as a parking lot \u2014 not directly to the customers  home or office address.\u201cThat too is very labor intensive because somebody has to bring items from a store to the curbside in the parking lot,\u201d Vijay said.Ottonomy.IO co-founders Hardik Sharma, Ashish Gupta, Ritukar Vijay and Pradyot Korupolu (from left to right). Image Credits: Ottonomy.IOThe robots built by Ottonomy.IO use high information mapping of the serviceable delivery areas to navigate and reach the consumer delivery locations. Once they reach their destination, the robots require a unique QR code that the customer received at the time of their order to unlock the hold area and retrieve the order, the startup said.Ottonomy.IO did some initial pilot rounds with its autonomous robots before bringing its latest model, Ottobot 2.0. This is an evolution from the early pilots and includes fully customizable modular cabins, increased customer access and directional mobility, including a crab mode that allows the robot to navigate sideways.The proprietary robot designed by Ottonomy.IO offers better accessibility to customers, the startup claimed.\u201cEven a person in a wheelchair can actually access packages from the robot, which is very, very important,\u201d Vijay said.Ottonomy.IO s robots claim to offer better accessibility support to customers. Image Credits: Ottonomy.IOThe executive also told TechCrunch that the robot has software capability of \u201cno GPS dependence\u201d and \u201cworks seamlessly\u201d for both indoor and outdoor autonomous mobility.According to Vijay, all these design elements and technological changes make Ottonomy.IO different from the competition that includes Starship, Kiwibot, Serve Robotics and Refraction AI, to name a few.\u201cIf you see the other players, they re either into indoor navigation or outdoor navigation. Given the capability of doing both opens multiple use cases for the company,\u201d Roopan Aulakh, managing director, Pi Ventures, told TechCrunch.Although the robots that Ottonomy.IO offers are developed in India, the company doesn t consider the country its potential market.\u201cOur intent was not to go to solve a problem where it is not there,\u201d said Vijay. \u201cOtherwise, India could have been a market where grouped housing societies can still leverage autonomous deliveries, but the problem is not there because labor costs are still affordable,\u201d he said.Ottonomy.IO has already deployed its robots at the Cincinnati International Airport and is in talks with multiple airports in the U.S. and Europe to expand its business.Vijay said that deploying the robots at airports was also a part of Ottonomy.IO s go-to-market strategy to help them receive public attention.The company said it was also working with top Fortune 500 companies in retail and restaurant industries across North America to widen its market, though it declined to identify them. Vijay said the startup is also working with a couple of fleet aggregators in Europe for last-mile deliveries. Ottonomy.IO also plans to expand to the Middle East and South America within this year, the executive said.Ottonomy.IO plans to deploy the fresh funds to bring the robots to customers already on board \u2014 across categories including curbsides and last-mile deliveries of F&B, retail and e-commerce packages.\u201cNext three to four or five months are very heavy in terms of deployments for us,\u201d Vijay said. The startup is also looking to expand its team. \u201cFrom our thesis perspective, Ottonomy.IO is a deep tech startup solving a global problem,\u201d said Aulakh. \u201cDeveloping the product in India, even manufacturing it here and selling it globally, I think is a great story, and which is what really excites us about this company.\u201dOttonomy.IO raised $1.6 million before the seed funding. Some of its early investors include former Apple employees, startup founders and angels from markets including Singapore, Europe, India, the Middle East and the U.S.",

        "title": "Kenyan insurtech Lami raises $3.7M seed extension led by Harlem Capital",
        "text": "Right from the launch of its first product in 2020, Kenyan insurtech Lami Technologies set out to increase insurance penetration in Kenya and the rest of Africa. It began on this path by building and distributing an end-to-end digital insurance platform and API that allowed businesses in different sectors to create tailored insurance solutions for their customers.With its API platform gaining ground in the insurance space, the startup is also planning to provide tech solutions that will digitize agents and brokers too, helping them streamline their operations \u2014 to reach a wide customer base and sell online. These plans also include enabling the digitization of traditional insurers as innovation continues to shape the industry.Speaking to Techcrunch, Lami s founder and CEO Jihan Abass further announced plans to offer additional insurance product lines, while also revealing that the startup has made an entry into Egypt and Nigeria. All this against the backdrop of a $3.7 million seed extension raised in a round led by Harlem Capital \u2014 which invests in minority and women founders.Insurtech, on the heels of a fintech boom, heats up in AfricaOther investors that participated in the round include early-stage VC firm Newtown Partners, Peter Bruce-Clark (a partner at New York s research-driven venture capital company Social Impact Capital), Caribou Honig and Jay Weintraub of InsureTech Connect (a networking platform for insurtech innovators) and senior members from Exotix Advisory, a corporate finance and mergers and acquisition boutique focused on emerging markets. The latest funding adds to the $1.8 million seed funding the insurtech raised last year.Speaking about its growth strategies, Ms. Abass affirmed the firm s plans to continuously innovate as they explore new ways of increasing insurance penetration across the continent \u2014 which currently stands at below 3%.\u201cOn the technology side we want to cater to the entire insurance ecosystem. So, it s not only the digital platforms that want to sell insurance products, but also to help existing players be more efficient in their distribution of products, allowing them to play a role in increasing the insurance penetration level. This includes agents and brokers \u2014 we are looking into how we can empower them to sell more policies,\u201d she said.Abass added that Lami is using the funding to hire, fast-track its expansion plans and drive underwriter partnerships. It has also appointed its CFO, Roy Perlot, who has been with the insurtech since 2020, as a co-founder.Explaining their investment in Lami, Harlem Capital principal Gabby Cazeau said: \u201cWe believe the next wave of fintech will embed financial products and services like insurance into a customer s purchase experience. Lami s approach to serving people through strategic partners in e-commerce and finance is the best way to build trust with users and deliver insurance in a seamless, accessible way to Africans across the continent.\u201dLami co-designs products with its underwriting partners, presently 25 in number, who help use its API to facilitate the distribution of insurance products via a B2B2C approach.Lami Technologies, which has expanded to Nigeria and Egypt, plans to offer additional insurance product lines. Image Credits: Lami TechnologiesThe startup s API allows entities like banks to offer digital insurance products to their customers. Lami has also integrated its API with more than 15 entities in various sectors, including logistics, e-commerce, banking and fintech.Among Lami s partners is buy now, pay later startup Lipa Later, which it supports through insurance against payment default for the financed products. The insurtech also works with Sendy to enable freight carriers in East Africa (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania) to access transit insurance on a per-trip basis, and also with Kwara to make insurance products accessible to the over 60,000 SACCO (credit union) members. Other clients are e-commerce platform Jumia, retail B2B and end-to-end distribution platform MarketForce and Stanbic Bank Insurance \u2014 which uses Lami s technology to power bancassurance products.Lami entered the market in January 2020, with a consumer-facing product, Griffin insurance, arguably the first digital car insurance platform. It then pivoted to offer a product-agnostic API platform that powers digital insurance products. This has helped it grow its portfolio to 85,000 from 70,000 policies at the end of 2021, and quadrupled the premiums underwritten to $800,000 last year \u2014 the company predicts that this will grow to over $2 million this year.Stanbic Bank uses Lami s SaaS platform to power its bancassurance products. Image Credits: Lami TechnologiesThe expected growth will largely be fueled by increasing partnerships and product lines, and the aggressive expansion plans it embarked on this year when it entered Malawi and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) after acquiring Bluewave. The acquisition helped Lami to tap Bluewave s clientele and technologies that enable access to micro-insurance products through diverse channels like USSD and WhatsApp chatbots.Abass anticipates more growth opportunities with additional partnerships from tech-enabled businesses and as more insurance companies digitize.\u201cInsurance companies have realized that they cannot rely on traditional distribution channels any longer; they need to also diversify for their own financial well-being. And then also when it comes to digital platforms, I think they ve also realized that it s an easy way for them to diversify their revenue streams,\u201d said Abass.\u201cThe landscape has really transformed since we launched our first product two years ago. People are more open to digital distribution channels. We expect to see significant growth on the B2B2C side. This is where we see a lot of opportunity as we expand into other markets.\u201dKenya s MotiSure rides on micro-payments to drive personal mobility insurance growthKenyan insurtech startup Lami enters Malawi, DRC after acquiring Bluewave, eyes rest of Africa",

Micromobility is feeling the pain as well.I reached out to about 20 companies building electric scooters and bikes, and most of them told me the same thing: Getting critical parts, like motors, out of China is becoming increasingly difficult, and Russia s war against Ukraine is making supplies like nickel expensive and hard to source. The result? More companies are trying to get at least final assembly as close to the end consumer as possible.Watch this space.

The late U.S. payment was only about four days late, but Serbian workers were waiting on June pay until the second week of July.This wasn t the first time Helbiz was late to pay employees. In early April, the operator missed payroll for U.S. employees, blaming a software glitch. A former employee told us Helbiz also missed payroll in Serbia in December 2020, with employees not seeing a check until February 2021.It seems the issues extend beyond late paychecks. Sources tell us that scooter supply shipments are also chronically late and complain the company is unstructured, causing issues throughout the organization.It s certainly troubling, especially given the company s plan to acquire another U.S.-based scooter operator,\u00a0Wheels.

And let s not forget the pandemic-related factory shutdowns in China.Another tidbit: GM s self-driving subsidiary Cruise is burning through cash, with expenses hitting around $550 million compared to $332 million during the same quarter of last year. Operating losses topped $605 million, up from $363 million last year. The increase in cost can be attributed to a headcount increase from revving up Cruise s robotaxi service, as well as a change in the compensation expense, according to CEO Kyle Vogt.Ford also saw losses in China, but gains in other regions helped the automaker bring in $40.2 billion in revenue, a 50% increase from the same period last year and an adjusted operating income that tripled to $3.7 billion.Spotify announced during its second-quarter earnings call that it has stopped manufacturing \u201cCar Thing,\u201d the company s in-vehicle device for controlling music.Future of flightUrban Movement Labs in Los Angeles is partnering with South Korea s Institute of Aerospace Industry-Academia Collaboration (IAIAC) to explore research opportunities around air mobility planning and integration.

        "text": "Hyundai Motor is considering increasing its stake in, or fully acquiring, the South Korea-based lidar-free autonomous mobility platform 42dot, the latest signal of its growing interest in the fast-growing space.A spokesperson of 42dot told TechCrunch that the startup is in talks with Hyundai Motor, but cautioned that terms, including stake size and deal valuation, hadn t materialized yet. Hyundai Motor did not immediately respond to requests for comments.Hyundai currently owns a 20.4% stake in the three-year-old startup, whereas 42dot s co-founder and chief executive Chang-Hyeon Song, who interestingly also leads the transportation-as-a-service (TaaS) team at Hyundai Motor, held a 36.19% stake as of December 2021, according to 42dot s regulatory filing. The rest is owned by venture capital firms and strategic investors, including LG Electronics, SK Telecom, Lotte Rental, CJ Logistics and LIG Nex1.The ongoing deliberation signals Hyundai Motor s accelerating efforts to strengthen its autonomous driving technology that is in line with the Korean automaker s grand plan to invest $79 billion (95.5 trillion WON) through 2030 into autonomous driving software technology and electric vehicle-related businesses. Hyundai Motor, which has said it aims to secure 7% of the global electric vehicle market by 2030, earmarked $9.2 billion (12 trillion WON) for connectivity and autonomous driving software investment.The news comes nearly nine months after 42dot raised $88.5 million in its Series A financing round at a valuation of about $425 million to accelerate its TaaS service and urban mobility operation system (UMOS).South Korean local media Korean Economic Daily first reported the news, citing anonymous sources, that Hyundai is in talks to invest at least 400 billion WON (~$306.4 million) in 42dot. According to the newspaper, Hyundai approached 42dot for the acquisition in June. The proposed deal could be completed this month, the paper said.Founded in 2019 by former Apple, Microsoft and Naver alum Song, 42dot has developed AKit, a self-driving software and hardware solution, and TAP, an autonomous mobility and logistics platform that offers a number of services across ride-hailing, fleet management, demand-responsive transport, smart logistics and more.Korean autonomous driving startup 42dot bags $88.5M Series A to accelerate its growth",

He said that one of the reasons the firm managed to accomplish this lies in the \u201csparks\u201d that determine which startup to invest in or not: team, market, knowledge of the customer and tech, and customer enthusiasm.\u00a0But even though firms follow a manual (like Oui Capital and its aforementioned investment strategies), not all deals turn out great. Oui Capital provides more extensive support for some of these startups by driving partnerships and sales, facilitating hires and providing bridge investments. With respect to follow-on capital, the managing partner said Oui Capital makes such investments proactively as part of the firm s ongoing portfolio monitoring. As it stands, Oui Capital has made follow-on investments in about 20% of its portfolio companies.\u00a0\u201cWe go the extra mile with founders whom we partner with and this is why we maintain a relatively smaller portfolio compared to many seed funds. However, there is a critical distinction between the responsibilities of a VC as an investor and as a fund manager,\u201d said the managing partner. \u201cBeing an investor begets the type of die-hard optimism and support as earlier described. Being an effective fund manager also puts the fiduciary responsibility on you to know when to stop devoting scarce resources to problems that might prove too difficult to fix and dedicate these resources to higher-performing companies in your portfolio to minimize losses and maximize investor value.\u201dThe Oui Capital team. Image Credits: Oui CapitalThough economic cycles like the one the startup world is experiencing are usually short to medium-term, Oyinsan echoes what local investors have communicated these past few months: the return of sticking to first principles and backing companies with strong fundamentals, unit economics and valuation discipline. This event has created an opportunity for investors, including Oui Capital, to invest up the chain, especially now that it has newly infused capital.\u00a0According to Oyinsan, the firm will be looking to cover the full spectrum of investments before Series A, including bridge rounds, an activity it will amplify, particularly during this current venture capital crunch. In related news, Zedcrest Capital, another VC firm, launched a $10 million \u201cemergency fund\u201d to bail out startups in pre-Series A stages last week.\u00a0From this new fund, Oui Capital intends to write initial checks of up to $750,000 (a 10x increase from the ticket size of its first fund) with reserves in place for such follow-on investments. \u201cExpect us to be leading many more deals across the ecosystem and vocalizing firm initiatives \u2014 all things that we ve been doing quietly in the past four years, but now looking to double down on these with the new fund,\u201d Oyinsan added.\u00a0Oui Capital s second fund welcomed a mix of individual and VC investors as limited partners. Individual investors such as Brad Feld, Seth Levine and Ryan McIntyre (Foundry Group s partners), Gbenga Oyebode, Alitheia Capital s Tokunboh Ishmael, Idris Alubankudi and TeamApt CEO Tosin Eniolorunda participated.\u00a0TeamApt will use its new funding round to provide digital bank services for the unbankedAs one of the largest fintechs in Africa (in revenue and market cap), TeamApt is, for now, the breakout success of Oui Capital s portfolio. The fintech, which, according to sources, is in the market to raise a Series C round next year, stands as one of the continent s lauded soonicorns. Thus, Eniolorunda becoming a limited partner at the firm is worthy of admiration as it is such a rare feat in these parts for founders to become LPs in the funds that backed their startups. Another example is Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade and pan-African early-stage fund, Ventures Platform.\u201cIt s a great feedback loop for us as a VC firm and speaks to the strength of our working relationship with TeamApt in the years even before our investment in the company,\u201d Peter Oriaifo, principal at Oui Capital, told TechCrunch regarding Eniolorunda s LP participation. \u201cThe founder-investor relationship is a testament of our work to back a founder at the seed stage and to see the company succeed to a point where they want to pay it forward.\u201dOui Capital invested in TeamApt when the fintech company was under the radar and before attracting the attention of other investors. Its success is one of the inspirations behind Oui Capital s pan-African approach. The firm is keen to make novel investments into startups it believes can become winners in their respective countries and sectors, said Oyinsan. Oui Capital highlights Maad (the first B2B marketplace for fast-moving consumer goods in Senegal) and Pharmacy Marts (a B2B marketplace for pharmacies in Egypt) as examples. As a result, the African countries where Oui Capital has made at least one investment include Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal, Egypt and South Africa. The firm plans to make more investments in North Africa and Francophone Africa, regions that witnessed increasing startup and venture capital activity last year when African tech funding hit record highs in correlation with global numbers.\u201cOur pan-African strategy has made us a fund of choice for global LPs looking for exposure to the broader Africa opportunity without having to get into the weeds of understanding different regions separately,\u201d stated Oyinsan. The global VCs involved in this second fund include Angur Nagpal s Vibe Capital, D Global ventures, Boston-based One Way Ventures and Ground Squirrel Ventures.AfricInvest and Cathay Innovation reach final close of Pan-African fund at \u20ac110MZedcrest launches $10 million  emergency fund  for African startups",

        "text": "Updated: Article updated to add the city of Richmond and the county of Montgomery in Virginia, as well as St. Augustine, Florida also confirming service has ended there.\u00a0Bolt Mobility, the Miami-based micromobility startup co-founded by Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt, appears to have vanished without a trace from several of its U.S. markets.\u00a0In some cases, the departure has been abrupt, leaving cities with abandoned equipment, unanswered calls and emails, and lots of questions.Bolt has stopped operating in at least eight U.S. cities, including Portland, Oregon, Burlington, South Burlington and Winooski in Vermont, Richmond, California and Richmond, Virginia, and St. Augustine, Florida according to city officials. Some city representatives also said they were unable to reach anyone at Bolt, including its CEO Ignacio Tzoumas. TechCrunch has made multiple attempts to reach Bolt and those who have backed the company. Emails to Bolt s communications department, several employees and investors went unanswered. Even the customer service line doesn t appear to be staffed.\u00a0Bolt halted its service in Portland on July 1. Because of the company s failure to provide the city with updated insurance and pay some outstanding fees, Portland subsequently suspended Bolt s permit to operate there, according to a city spokesperson.\u00a0Bolt zooms then stallsBolt Mobility (not to be confused with the European transportation super app also named Bolt) was on what appeared to be a growth streak about 18 months ago. The company\u00a0acquired in January 2021 the assets of Last Mile Holdings, which owned micromobility companies Gotcha and OjO Electric. The purchaser opened up 48 new markets to Bolt Mobility, most of which were smaller cities such as Raleigh, North Carolina, St. Augustine, Florida and Mobile, Alabama.\u00a0After purchasing Last Mile s assets, Bolt agreed to continue as the bike-share vendor in Chittenden County, Vermont, including cities Burlington, South Burlington and Winooski. That license was even renewed in 2022, said Bryan Davis, senior transportation planner of the county.\u00a0\u201cWe learned a couple of weeks ago (from them) that Bolt is ceasing operations,\u201d Davis told TechCrunch via email, noting that Bolt ceased operations July 1, but actually informed the county a week later. \u201cThey ve vanished, leaving equipment behind and emails and calls unanswered. We re unable to reach anyone, but it seems they ve closed shop in other markets as well.\u201dSandy Thibault, executive director of Chittenden Area Transportation Management Association, told the Burlington Free Press that Bolt communicated that employees were being let go and the company s board of directors was discussing next steps.A spokesperson at Burlington relayed similar information.\u201cAll of our contacts at Bolt, including their CEO, have gone radio silent and have not replied to our emails,\u201d Robert Goulding, public information manager at Burlington s Department of Public Works, told TechCrunch.Davis went on to say that about 100 bikes have been left on the ground completely inoperable and with dead batteries. Chittenden County has given Bolt a time frame in which to claim or remove the company s vehicles, otherwise the county will take ownership of them.\u00a0\u00a0Bolt also appears to have stopped operating in Richmond, California, according to Richmond Mayor Tom Butt s e-forum.\u00a0\u201cUnfortunately, Bolt apparently went out of business without prior notification or removal of their capital equipment from city property,\u201d wrote Butt. \u201cThey recently missed the city s monthly meeting check-in and have been unresponsive to all their clients throughout all their markets.\u201dButt went on to say that the city is coming up with a plan to remove all the abandoned equipment \u2014 about 250 e-bikes that were available at hub locations like BART stations and the ferry terminal \u2014 and asked people to refrain from vandalizing the bikes until the city could come up with a solution.\u00a0Service has also ended in Richmond, Virginia. The city confirmed that Bolt Mobility s permit with the City of Richmond ends today, August 1, 2022.\u201cThe city was informed June 7, 2022 that Bolt Mobility would be ceasing their operations in the City of Richmond (Virginia),\u201d a company spokesperson said in an email. \u201cScooter companies operate on an annual permit, Bolt paid all its fees with the City of Richmond on August 1, 2021.\u201dThe Roanoke Times recently reported that Bolt s bikeshare service, operated under the name RoamNRV, has been inoperable in Montgomery County, where the university Virginia Tech is located, since July 6. Representatives from the town of Blacksburg, where most of Bolt s service was located, could not be reached in time for comment, but the local outlet reports that there are signs posted where the bikes are parked stating they re not operational.TechCrunch has reached out to several other cities in which Bolt operates and has not been able to confirm that the company has stopped operating entirely. A spokesperson from St. Augustine originally told TechCrunch Bolt s bike share was running as usual there, but after looking into the matter further, has since confirmed the service is suspended.\u00a0Bolt s social media has also been rather inactive in recent weeks. The company hasn t posted on Instagram since June 11 or on Twitter since June 2.\u00a0The last time TechCrunch heard from Bolt was nine months ago when the company was peddling its in-app navigation system that it dubbed \u201cMobilityOS.\u201d At the time, the startup promised that its next generation of scooters would include a smartphone mount that would double as a phone charger, but it s unclear if those scooters ever hit the streets.\u00a0Bolt has publicly raised $40.2 million, an amount that doesn t include an undisclosed investment from India s Ram Charan Company in May. Investors there could not be reached for comment.",

Based in Chicago, the investor told regulators this week via an SEC filing that it has locked down just over $50 million for a new fund. Buoyant declined to comment when emailed by TechCrunch, but the filing shows the firm has been raising cash for the fund since at least May 2021. So far, 75 (unnamed) limited partners have chipped in, and Buoyant is fishing for just shy of $50 million more.\u00a0Led by Electronic Arts and Energize Ventures alum Amy Francetic and former Accenture executive Allison Myers, Buoyant s first deal dates back to the summer of 2020. That s when it backed Raptor Maps, which aims to help solar farms squeeze more juice from the sun by spotting issues \u2014 like panel damage and shading \u2014 with drones and sensors.Buoyant said in 2021 that it s focused on \u201csolutions for the industries contributing the most to carbon emissions,\u201d including power, transportation, agriculture and buildings.

        "title": "Drover AI is using computer vision to keep scooter riders off sidewalks",
        "text": "Shared micromobility companies have been adopting startlingly advanced new tech to correct for the thing that cities hate most \u2014 sidewalk riding. Some companies, like Bird, Neuron and Superpedestrian, have relied on hyperaccurate GPS systems to determine if a rider is riding inappropriately. Others, like Lime, have started integrating camera-based computer vision systems that rely on AI and machine learning to accurately detect where a rider is.The latter camp has largely leaned on the innovations of Drover AI, a Los Angeles\u2013based startup that has tested and sold its attachable IoT module to the likes of Spin, Voi, Helbiz, Beam and Fenix to help operators improve scooter safety and, most importantly, win city permits.Drover, which was founded in May 2020, closed out a $5.4 million Series A Wednesday. The startup will use the funds to continue building on the next generation of PathPilot, Drover s IoT module that contains a camera and a compute system that analyzes visual data and issues commands directly to the scooter. Depending on the city s needs, the scooters will either make noises to alert a rider that they re driving on the sidewalk or slow them down. The new version, called PathPilot Lite, will do much of the same, except it will be more integrated, better and cheaper, says Drover s co-founder and chief business officer Alex Nesic.Drover has modules on over 5,000 vehicles with orders for over 15,000 more that the company needs to deliver by the end of the year, according to Nesic.Getting those next-gen modules into production will require hiring a few more minds across the engineering and project management side of things, as well as in government relations and communications over in Europe to aid Drover s expansion across the pond.Nesic said Drover also intends to hire a software engineer to help build out the data dashboards the company offers to micromobility partners.Drover s operator-facing beta dashboard that breaks trips down by infrastructure used. Image Credits: Drover AI\u201cWe have a beta dashboard that shows a color-coded version of what trips look like broken down by infrastructure, how much time each vehicle spends on each section, and in aggregate across an entire fleet,\u201d Nesic told TechCrunch. \u201cWe have a parking validation dashboard where for any one of your vehicles deployed in the city, you can see where the ride ended, what our AI scored the parking job as along with a photo. So all these tools we re offering our operator customers that they could build themselves based on the data we re already sharing with them, but they just don t have the bandwidth, so these customer-facing tools are a value add.\u201dDrover also sells its data to cities and is exploring the use of distributed cameras moving through cities to build out a suite of tools that could potentially provide a city-facing dashboard that displays information like the state of infrastructure or bike lane violations, which is a \u201cpet project\u201d of Nesic s.\u201cOur system can tell you, for example, the rider was on the bike lane for 20% of the time, 30% of the time on the sidewalk and the rest in the street,\u201d said Nesic. \u201cThat can inform a lot of policy decisions on where to put bike lanes or whether the bike lanes you ve invested in are working.\u201dDrover has been receiving interest from transportation agencies like Transport for London, as well as insurance companies that want this kind of granular data to understand how new mobility modes are being used in the infrastructure.There are some who say the future of micromobility is really in owned vehicles, rather than shared. If that s the case, it stands to reason that shared micromobility sets the trends that future private scooters will have to live by. Advanced rider assistance systems are becoming table stakes for operators moving forward who want to win cities, and Nesic thinks policy for private vehicles might soon follow \u2014 in fact, he s hoping it does.\u201cPart of the money we raised is gonna go towards exploring other integrations further up the supply chain with vehicle manufacturers and IoT manufacturers,\u201d said Nesic. \u201cThe real goal is to drive the cost down, and if we can, already have our tech be a feature set of the next gen IoT that has compute capability already, and then we re just licensing Drover s AI, which is equipped to handle different infrastructure across the globe.\u201dBut that s way down the line. For the short-term, Drover is still hyperfocused on expanding off the backs of shared scooter companies that are increasingly hearing demand for this kind of tech from cities.Drover s Series A was led by Vektor Partners, a VC firm focusing on the future of mobility. The firm recently raised a \u20ac125 million fund for sustainable mobility, which is where Drover s recent raise came from.Advanced rider assistance systems: Tech spawned by the politics of micromobility",

        "title": "Sono Motors reveals final design of its solar-charging Sion EV",
        "text": "Sono Motors unveiled this week the final production design of the Sion EV, a solar electric vehicle that s been in the making since the Munich-based startup launched in 2016.It s been a long and bumpy road for Sono Motors, a journey that involved a couple of crowdfunding campaigns, a near insolvency and a debut on the Nasdaq exchange as a publicly traded company.The solar-powered fruits of those rather tumultuous labors were shown off at its bustling \u201cCelebrate the Sun\u201d Community event. The Sion solar-powered EV took center stage. However, another product called the Solar Bus Kit, a series of solar panels that are designed to be retrofitted onto 12-meter public buses, suggests the company has more ambitious plans beyond one passenger vehicle.The question, of course, is can Sono Motors produce and sell the EV at volume? And how?Sono aims to begin deliveries of the Sion in the second half of 2023 to customers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The company did not provide guidance on how many Sions would be delivered next year. The only metric it has shared is that it expects to make 43,000 Sions per year with a production capacity of 257,000 over seven years, according to a company spokesperson.However, even the most well-funded EV startups have had trouble making it to production recently. Sono has had to combat a range of challenges since going public in November last year, from a plummeting stock price to switching manufacturing partners, and its path forward to production and delivery will likely continue to be bumpy given current market and supply chain uncertainty.Let s break down what this company is up to:The Sion s final production designThe Sion will consist of 456 integrated solar half-cells that will collect power from the sun and enable self-sufficiency on shorter journeys. Image Credits: Sono MotorsThe Sion is a compact, five-door, family-friendly hatchback that will sell for \u20ac25,126 (~$25,628 at today s conversion). Its outer shell will consist of 456 integrated solar half-cells that will collect power from the sun and enable self-sufficiency on shorter journeys. Of course, the vehicle will still use a traditional charger to refuel, but the constant drip feed of solar should be enough to take care of most urban commutes, the company says.The car s 54 kWh lithium iron phosphate battery has a range of about 190 miles. Sono expects the energy generated by the solar cells to extend that by an average of 70 miles, and up to 152 miles, each week. In addition, the Sion is built with bidirectional charging technology, which allows commuters to use energy stored in the battery (~11 kW) to power homes or other electronic devices.[gallery ids=\"2360114,2360119,2360115\"]Other enhancements to the final design s exterior and interior includes a sleeker, cleaner-looking vehicle, according to Sono.The exterior has new headlights, including a new daylight strip, rear lights, a rear camera, a bottom sideline design and a revamped charging lid in front. There are also new door handles, which photos show have the words \u201cmade to be shared\u201d \u2014 a nod to Sono s hope to get this car into fleets.Sono says paid reservations have increased from 13,000 last November to more than 19,000. That could mean a net sales volume of \u20ac415 million if all reservations result in sales. With an average down payment of \u20ac2,225, Sono could have over \u20ac42 million in the bank to help it get to production.(By the way, if those numbers \u2014 19,000 x \u20ac25,126 \u2014 don t quite add up, it s because the price of the Sion has shifted over time and earlier backers are grandfathered into their original prices, says a company spokesperson.)To bring costs down, Sono Motors has relied on outsourcing its vehicle s manufacture and distribution. Previously, Sono planned to partner with NEVS, the Swedish EV manufacturer that acquired the assets of the bankrupt Saab Automobile in 2012. But NEVS s parent firm, Evergrande, is deep in debt and is still trying to sell NEVS, which is still struggling to put its Saab 9-3 into production.Sono switched gears in April and signed a contract with a new partner, Valmet Automotive, which manufactures in Finland.The solar bus kitSono s solar bus kit includes eight square-meters of solar panels that provide around 1.4 kW at peak installation. Image Credits: Sono MotorsWhile Sono s solar bus kit can t turn a diesel-pumping bus into an eco-friendly hybrid, it can take some of the emissions out of the equation.The kit, which has been standardized to work with \u201cvirtually all European bus fleets,\u201d can save up to 1,500 liters of diesel and up to four tons of CO2 per bus per year, according to the company. Its total size of about eighrt square-meters of solar panels provide around 1.4 kW at peak installation. That solar energy can be used to power a bus  subsystems such as HVAC.Sono said bus fleet operators stand to see a potential payback time of about three to four years, depending on the sunniness of days in operation and fuel prices.At CES 2021, Sono said it would license its solar body panel technology to other companies as an additional source of revenue, and this new bus kit is a part of that move to diversify the business.Since going public, Sono says it has ongoing letters of intent, pilots and prototypes for 19 companies that are implementing the company s solar technology on a variety of vehicle architectures, like buses, trailers, trucks and electric transporters. For example, Sono recently piloted a solar bus trailer in Munich to provide backup power for public transport. Sono has also partnered with the Reefer Group, a manufacturer of refrigerated semi-trailers, to build a solar trailer for testing.The company said its B2B solar business is already generating revenue, more details of which will be shared during the company s earnings call in September. Sono s stock has plummeted since its debut, losing close to 93% of its value, so the company will definitely need to earn another source of revenue as it revs up for production next year.Why Sono stock has taken a hitWhen Sono Group, the parent company of Sono Motors, began trading, it opened at $20.06 after the IPO was initially priced at $15. Shares hit a high of $38.74 before the market closed on its first day. At the time of this writing, Sono Group is trading at $2.64, a slide that has continued even after the company revealed the production version of the Sion.It seems the buzz around EV startups has started to fizzle.In May, Sono closed its previously announced underwritten follow-on offering of 10 million ordinary shares, with an additional 1.5 million shares available for the underwriters \u2014 which include Cantor Fitzgerald and B. Riley Securities \u2014 at an even greater discount.Sono said it gained $40 million in gross proceeds from this offering, which it used to help fund the start of production of its Sion, but investors are likely to see the offering as one that devalues shares to an even greater extent.",

        "title": "Nash raises cash to help merchants manage local deliveries",
        "text": "The pandemic normalized delivery in the U.S. But even before the health crises struck, delivery sales at restaurants alone were increasing at a rate of 7% to 8% per year, roughly twice that of sales across the entire restaurant industry, according to McKinsey. The trouble is, delivery can be a nightmare from the restaurant and merchant side. Among other challenges, businesses often rely on a single partner to make their deliveries, making them highly susceptible to fluctuations in supply and demand and service reliability.On a mission to make deliveries less of a headache, Mahmoud Ghulman founded Nash, a platform that aggregates delivery providers to allow businesses to select those that make the most sense, price- and availability-wise. Nash plugs into third-party delivery APIs from DoorDash, Lyft, Uber and other partners, providing customers with software to manage and offer local deliveries to their customers.\u201cOver the past few years, my co-founders and I watched how consumers have come to expect incredibly fast, reliable delivery at an affordable price given what the retail, delivery, and transportation giants have accomplished,\u201d Ghulman told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cHowever, this has created a landscape where medium and small businesses struggle to meet consumer demands due to the complexity and high cost associated with running and maintaining a last-mile delivery operation. So we became really interested in building a software and logistics solution that would allow any business to easily activate reliable local delivery by building custom workflows and tapping into a large network of delivery providers.\u201dImage Credits:\u00a0NashGhulman met Nash s other co-founder, Aziz Alghunaim, at a science fair in high school, and the two attended MIT together. Alghunaim was previously an engineer at Palantir and helped launch Tarjimly, a Y Combinator-backed startup aiming to reduce language barriers for refuges while providing access to support services.Ghulman and Alghunaim co-founded Nash in early 2021, and the company participated in Y Combinator s S21 batch. Impressing investors, evidently, Nash today closed a $20 million Series A round led by Andreesen Horowitz with support from Y Combinator, Rackhouse Venture Capital and \u201cleaders across the tech and supply chain space.\u201d\u201cToday s newly announced $20 million Series A capital brings our total funding to $27.8 million, as it comes right on the heels of our previously unannounced $7.8 million seed round from late last year, which Andreesen Horowitz also led,\u201d Ghulman said. \u201cThis funding will be used to double down on hiring in engineering, operations, sales, and other key business functions. We plan to grow our 25-employee headcount by more than 2x to 3x by the end of the year to match our explosive growth.\u201dUsing Nash, businesses can choose delivery providers manually or have the platform do it automatically. Either way, they get price and time estimates plus information about the delivery person, including their contact information and location.Tens of thousands of merchants can access the platform for individual and batched (i.e. multi-pickup) delivery routes through Nash s partnerships, Ghulman claims, reaching up to 94% of the U.S. population in close to 1,000 cities.To optimize routes, Nash uses AI and machine learning to predict a courier s on-time delivery performance given variables like pickup time, drop-off time, package value, distance and drive time. Nash supports a range of different delivery options, Ghulman says, including scheduled and same-hour deliveries as well as store-to-store deliveries and customer returns.\u00a0\u201cWhat we re doing for delivery is what Stripe has done for payments: we have built a simple API and workflow builder,\u201d Ghulman continued. \u201cBusinesses can build a customized delivery workflow by leveraging our API platform or access Nash directly through our technical partnerships with industry-leading marketplaces, aggregators, and point-of-sale providers. This approach makes it easy for teams to reduce the technical overhead required to maintain a high-performance delivery operation.\u201dImage Credits: NashThe on-demand delivery market, which was always on the capital-intensive side, isn t particularly healthy at the moment, as evidenced by the mass layoffs at delivery startups like Gopuff. Ghulman declined to offer firm numbers on Nash s revenue and customer base, but assured me that Nash hasn t been impacted by the broader slowdown and is \u201cwell-positioned\u201d to weather potential headwinds.\u201d\u201cThe pandemic brought an unimaginable surge in demand for local delivery across all industries. Many companies couldn t keep up. Some were even forced to shut down. And launching or operating a delivery business was even more challenging than usual due to a reduced workforce,\u201d Ghulman said. \u201cBy removing the technical, logistical, and operational overhead associated with offering a reliable delivery experience, Nash helped hundreds of businesses access new customers and revenue streams.\u201dAs for what s next, Nash plans to further expand into verticals like retail, car parts, pet supplies, catering and meal kits, laundry, flowers, printing and framing, pharma and small parcels. It s also casting its gaze toward new markets, including Canada and the U.K., where Nash plans to launch by the end of the year.",

        "title": "Allwhere launches out of stealth to help companies manage their remote workforces",
        "text": "Given the recent economic downturn, some companies are skeptical that the pandemic-led move to remote and hybrid work will have staying power. According to an April survey by Good Hire, 77% of managers said they d consider firing employees or cutting their pay for refusing to return to the office. Most expressed concerns about remote employees  perceived lack of focus, negative impact on company culture, and productivity issues.Oscar Mattsson is of a different opinion. That s not shocking, because his startup, Allwhere, sells businesses tools for facilitating remote work. Emerging from stealth today with $9.5 million in seed funding from DESCOvery, Allwhere aims to work with companies to implement remote work setups, manage the lifecycle of equipment from procurement to disposal, and craft onboarding, engagement, retention and wellness programs, Mattsson said.\u201cWhile the current market is temporary, the new ethos that s emerged regarding flexibility and employee wellness is permanent. Teams have realized that they can work just as efficiently using a distributed model, and a strict return-to-office plan often leads to losing top contributors even in a recession,\u201d Mattsson said. \u201c[But] after two years of remote and hybrid work, nearly half of knowledge workers still do not have the tools they need to do their job. As a result, budgets are lost and employees are stretched thin, which is why companies outsource these tasks in the first place.\u201dMattsson began his career at WeWork, where he was a founding member of the company s enterprise division before working with partners to expand WeWork into daycare, food and beverage, mobility, and other areas. While he saw WeWork through its low points, Mattsson says he ultimately saw the value in services that enable flexible work.Mattsson founded Allwhere in 2021 within DESCOvery, D.E. Shaw s venture studio, where he was joined by WeWork alumni Ben Kessler (Allwhere s chief marketing officer) and Josh Rosenthal (head of customer experience).\u201cI saw a gap in the market for a solution that catered to the needs of businesses that were adapting to a newly remote, hybrid and distributed world,\u201d Mattsson said. \u201cAllwhere is an Old English term meaning \u2018everywhere,  which aligns with our mission to support employees and employers in any type of workplace.\u201dAllwhere furnishes corporate customers with employee equipment, products, tools and perks, even going so far as to find vendors and suppliers. In addition to installation and retrieval of office hardware, furniture and accessories, Allwhere provides wellness programs, subscriptions, gifts, IT hardware repairs and upgrades, and more.Image Credits: AllwhereUsing Allwhere, companies can build their own white-labeled \u201cstores\u201d with configurable kits and HR and IT process integrations. Dashboards allow management to oversee the doling out of equipment, wellness and perks as well as budgets and status updates. Meanwhile, when provided a link to the aforementioned store, employees can select the equipment, benefits and services they need and get tracking information and pick-up and delivery options for any applicable equipment.Mattsson says Allwhere has worked with customers looking to onboard new hires with hundreds of laptops to companies purchasing merch \u2014 branded backpacks, T-shirts, and the like \u2014 for their first in-person events post-pandemic.\u201cConcretely, Allwhere provides white glove, personalized service at scale, so internal teams can focus on other tasks,\u201d Mattsson said. \u201cMost companies are working with different vendors for all of these different things, so the HR, IT and executive teams we speak with are often relieved to find a solution that does it all.\u201dMattsson notes that during the pandemic, companies attempted to maximize the value of their IT assets in particular even at the expense of employee satisfaction. A 2020 survey by Nulab found that nearly a third of people working remotely due to the pandemic had to purchase equipment out of pocket for work.The pressure to cut operations costs is increasing as a recession threatens to materialize.What downturn? Investors remain bullish on HR tech as the Great Resignation slows\u201cMany companies are scaling back budgets, reducing the sizes of their teams, and experiencing equipment supply chain issues for the new hires they are bringing on. We solve all of those pain points with competitive pricing and efficient retrievals, both of which optimize inventory and trim vendors,\u201d Mattsson said. \u201cThese services sit at the core of our business and benefit our customers especially in the current market \u2026 While it s in theory possible to have internal teams handle equipment management, employee wellness, and swag, among our other offerings, it s not the most economically sound or effective solution.\u201dMattsson says New York-based Allwhere has customers ranging from startups to enterprises in North America, Latin America, and Europe \u2014 though he wouldn t reveal names. The focus in the next year will be on hiring and scaling operations, as well as expanding the capabilities of Allwhere s platform, he said.\u201cIn response to demand, Allwhere continues to grow rapidly. We ve tripled in size in just a few short months, and plan to double again by the end of the year,\u201d Mattsson added.",

        "title": "Can Alto succeed at employee-driven ride-hail?",
        "text": "Ride-hail startup Alto thinks the current gig worker-based market is inherently broken. Drivers  salaries are squeezed by the costs of owning and maintaining a vehicle; riders aren t guaranteed a high-quality service; cities have had to deal with angry taxi drivers; and the app-based companies themselves that have undercharged users to expand into new markets are still not seeing the profits from a growth-at-all costs mindset.Alto founders started the company in 2018 to solve those problems by taking more control over the whole ride-hail experience. The startup actually leases its own fleet of ride-hail vehicles, employs drivers and is regulated as a transportation company. Yes, that means it s more expensive to ride than your average Lyft or Uber, but CEO Will Coleman says Alto isn t for everybody; it s for customers who have a higher willingness to both pay and wait for a good thing.Hence the name \u2014 \u201cAlto\u201d means tall, high, elevated or superior in Spanish.Earlier this month, Alto launched its service in San Francisco, its sixth market across the U.S. The startup also operates in Dallas, Houston, Miami, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, and says it is continuing to expand its model. To date, Alto has about 2,000 drivers on its platform driving 400 vehicles, and is awaiting a shipment of 600 more vehicles.Alto is just one of many new ride-hail startups that are hoping to solve the many flaws of the gig worker model. Revel, for example, has a fleet of Teslas driven exclusively by employees in New York, and Earth is doing something similar in Texas. Meanwhile, worker-owned apps like the Co-Op Ride app is owned collectively by the drivers, which the company says allows drivers to earn 8% to 10% more than those who work for Uber or Lyft.Alto, which last raised a $45 million Series B in the summer of 2021, says it has grown 420% year-over-year (although the company didn t say up from what), and attributes this growth to a differentiated level of service.Map of Alto s ride-hail service in San Francisco. Image Credits: Alto\u201cWe needed to employ our drivers so that we could not only select and vet, but importantly, train and performance-manage them to drive a consistent high-quality experience for our passengers,\u201d Coleman told TechCrunch. \u201cWe own the vehicles so we can clean them, maintain them, keep them safe and ensure that our customer gets the experience that they expect in every single ride.\u201dThe vehicles in Alto s fleet are all luxury, midsize SUVs \u2014 currently Buick Enclaves and VW Atlases \u2014 that feature leather interiors, plexiglass partitions and in-vehicle WiFi, according to the company. The goal is to transition to a full EV fleet starting early next year, depending on vehicle availability.To ensure a smooth transition to EVs, Alto is working on building electric infrastructure charging hubs for its future fleet in all of the cities in which the company currently operates, plus Silicon Valley.Riders can only access Alto s service through a membership of $12.95 per month or $99 per year, which Coleman says creates a higher bar to acquisition but one that ensures Alto acquires customers who are more profitable over time because they ride more frequently.\u201cWe don t have to build to the same peaks that our competitors do,\u201d said Coleman.While the membership model may be a successful one in the long term, it s all about how you sell it. Multiple app reviews on the Google Play store and on Apple s App Store show customers who are disgruntled at being confronted by a request to put in their credit card details immediately upon opening the app, instead of giving them time to play around, review pricing for rides or even determine if Alto services the passenger s area.In fact, based on reviews, the app seems to have a number of problems that are putting off users. Over the past year, customers have had problems with pre-booked rides not showing up, the app freezing, inability to get verified, a difficult user interface, no way to contact drivers and more.\u201cDownloaded, signed up and paid my monthly fee thinking that with employees and such I was paying a premium for a more reliable service,\u201d wrote one app reviewer. \u201cBooked a car for the first time, two days in advance for an airport trip. They no showed and we called and they have no idea why the car isn t on the way. Ordered a Lyft and it was here before Alto could even figure out what happened. Do not recommend.\u201dMany reviewers did say their rides were clean and smooth and enjoyed the \u201cvibe\u201d of the service, but were deterred by issues with poor customer service and an unideal app experience.In response to this, Alto said because it owns and operates its own fleet, capacity is inherently limited.\u201cThe future of ridesharing is in fleets \u2014 first electric, then autonomous. In that scenario, supply will always be more constrained than in a gig model,\u201d said Coleman in a follow-up email. \u201cYou have to believe that to build a fleet-based, profitable ridesharing company, customers will ultimately be willing to call a ride ~10 minutes ahead (for a better, safer, experience) versus expecting three-minute pickup times.\u201dColeman went on to say Alto is constantly working to improve the app experience and grow its fleet to best serve its members.Employees today, robots tomorrow\u201cWe really think of ourselves as a human-driven autonomous fleet, and then that way we re also solving for the future,\u201d said Coleman.Alto s end game is to create the vehicle-operating platform now that can, in the future, be used with autonomous vehicles. Coleman argues Alto s tech stack has optimization capabilities that are more cut out for such a transition than Uber and Lyft s, simply because those companies don t manage the supply.\u201cWe think about orchestration, how to optimize the best outcome for our entire fleet and customer base, rather than any individual independent contractor, to drive asset utilization and therefore profitability,\u201d said Coleman. \u201cUber and Lyft have built no operating capability, quite frankly. We re building the real estate footprint, the charging infrastructure, and just the know-how on how to clean and store and maintain these fleets of hundreds of vehicles in all the cities in which we operate.\u201dColeman brings up a good point, namely that it might be easier for a company that has existing operating capabilities to transition to, well, operating a fleet of autonomous vehicles \u2014 something that top executives at Uber and Lyft are no doubt crossing their fingers for so they can be done with the pesky problem of dealing with drivers  rights.For his part, Coleman doesn t think either company could even afford to move to an employee-driven model today.\u201cTheir model is predatory towards drivers, and if they can t make their model sustainable with that, then there s no way they can make it sustainable with employees,\u201d said Coleman.Leaked Uber Files reveal history of lawbreaking, lobbying and exploiting violence against drivers",

Within the last three months, the fund launched two sister entities: a $110 million crypto fund and a $500 million health fund. Cathay Innovation carries a different approach in Africa. Unlike other regions where the firm invests from its multistage fund and ventures on its own, for Africa, it partnered with the Tunisian-based AfricInvest in 2019 to back promising early to growth-stage startups on the continent.Founded in 1994, AfricInvest handles multiple asset classes, from private equity to venture capital to private credit.

A track record such as this is what Cathay Innovation \u2014 which has $2 billion in AUM and offices across San Francisco, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Beijing and Singapore \u2014 sought four years ago when bought firms struck the partnership and formed CAIF.\u00a0CAIF first announced its fund in 2019.

While the fund s final close suggests that the fundraising plans didn t go as planned for various reasons, Denis Barrier, co-founder and CEO of Cathay Innovation, told TechCrunch that CAIF adjusted its expectations and settled on raising \u20ac100 million. \u201cSo, in fact, we exceeded this target in terms of fundraising,\u201d he said.\u00a0The chief executive also highlighted how CAIF s backing of early-stage founders allowed the firm to change its strategy and reaffirm its initial conviction of making seed to Series A deals. However, it has made some later-stage bets too. Per a statement, the firm invests up to \u20ac1 million in seed stage and between \u20ac1 million and \u20ac10 million in growth-stage businesses.\u00a0Yassine Oussaifi, a partner at AfricInvest and co-head of CAIF, said the firm backs startups with \u201cstrong\u201d unique selling propositions (USPs) and helps them to become regional leaders before they pursue global ambitions. It s a step-by-step the partner narrates. Africa is a big but fragmented market. As startups need to expand from their home countries to another \u2014 for instance, Lagos to Nairobi or Cairo to Casablanca \u2014 to achieve massive scale, the importance of firms like CAIF with resources on the ground cannot be overstated. But beyond these continental borders, utilizing Cathay Innovation s network is critical.\u00a0\u201cWe work hand in hand in investing in Africa,\u201d Oussaifi told TechCrunch on a call. \u201cAfricInvest brings its network and presence on the ground to African entrepreneurs. And then the next stage, we work with Cathay to help these companies expand beyond Africa, go to other emerging markets, and work with the expertise and know-how in markets they have developed across the years.\u201dSouth African startups Aerobotics and WhereIsMyTransport are examples that show this process. Both companies, having made significant headway in their home countries and other African markets, expanded to the U.S. and Mexico, respectively, with eyes on other international markets. In some cases, CAIF has funded companies incorporated outside Africa but with operations on the continent \u2014 for instance, Heetch, a Paris-headquartered ride-hailing startup active in Algeria and Morocco. Cathay Innovation was an investor in Heetch before CAIF backed the startup following its move into Africa.\u00a0There are seven other startups in CAIF s portfolio: 54gene,\u00a0OZ\u00c9, Migo, PalmPay, KaiOS, Boomplay and GOMYCODE (the fund co-led its recent round). They represent the sectors CAIF is keen on, namely fintech, mobility, digital content, agritech, health tech and edtech.\u00a0\u201cOur objective was that our portfolio companies will bring their products and services to benefit 100 million users in Africa. We ve already reached almost 150 million users that have used our products or services,\u201d said Oussaifi on the wide-reaching impact of portfolio startups that CAIF manages across its 8 locations.TLcom Capital targets $150M for its second fund to invest in 20 African startupsNorrsken, VCs and 30 unicorn founders set up $200M fund to back growth-stage startups in AfricaAfrica s venture capital scene reached an inflection point last year, topping over $5 billion, more than it had combined in the previous two years. Global funds have been the main catalysts but take nothing away from large Pan-African funds such as TLcom Capital,\u00a0Partech,\u00a0Norrsken22,\u00a0Novastar \u2014 and now CAIF \u2014 who have also pulled their weight by raising nearly $800 million in available capital between themselves.CAIF noted that this final close places it in a solid position to double down its efforts to focus on \u201cinnovative and scalable post-revenue\u201d ventures. Several LPs invested in this fund, including BIO, EIB, Proparco, SIFEM, AfricaGrow, Triodos Investment Management and FMO. CAIF, in a statement, said DFIs, multinational corporations and HNIs across Europe, Africa and the Middle East were also involved.\u00a0Like many funds in this year s first half, CAIF is announcing its fund s close amid venture capital slowdown and economic downturn. In response to how the firm approaches investments during this period, Barrier said: \u201cIn our portfolio, we see companies with good metrics and continue to expand. So even if there is a dip in valuation, the fundamentals of digitization and innovation in the next ten years are more true than ever. So we will continue to be very confident with what we are doing. If our portfolio companies stopped doing business and aren t growing, we could be worried. But it s not the case.\u201d\u00a0Oussaifi, giving his thoughts on a broader context, believes the venture capital slowdown is a short-term event in Africa. As long as the tech ecosystem continues to evolve and diversify from fintech and the Big Four to other sectors and regions, startups will continue to raise money to grow and scale, he said.",

        "text": "Gbike, a South Korea-based micromobility Gcooter operator, is acquiring Hyundai Motor s shared micromobility platform\u00a0ZET\u00a0as it wants to increase its market share and create technological synergies via ZET s fleet management system.\u00a0Gbike CEO Walter Yoon told TechCrunch that the deal, which is its first acquisition, will be completed in early August. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\u00a0South Korea s consolidations appear to start in the shared micromobility industry after many e-scooter players jumped into the sector in 2019, Yoon said in an interview with TechCrunch. Gbike has been approached by potential buyers to be acquired while the startup was looking for acquisition targets itself, Yoon said, adding that it is in talks with another company to acquire.\u201cThis year might be the time for consolidation [in the e-scooter industry],\u201d Yoon said. \u201cWe are very open to any other opportunity.\u201dThe ZET team will not join Gbike s team and will remain at Hyundai, Yoon noted. The acquisition brings the startup s total vehicle size up to about 45,000. (Gbike, which added a fleet of 20,000 e-scooters last year, will acquire ZET s fleet of fewer than 1,000 e-scooters.)\u00a0\u00a0In 2019, Hyundai launched the ZET platform that enables anyone to start a micromobility business in their cities. ZET operates its service in South Korea s major cities, including Jeju, Daegu and Incheon. Yoon explained that ZET is like a micromobility franchise platform, making it easier for franchisees to launch their own business.\u00a0Yoon pointed out that many e-scooter companies suspended or closed last year because of South Korea s revised regulation, which took effect in May 2021, that requires e-scooter users to wear a helmet and have a valid driver s license and be 16 years or older.\u00a0More than 20 e-scooter rental startups are operating over 50,000 e-scooters in Seoul, South Korea s capital. Several e-scooter companies, like Lime, Wind Mobility, Neuron and local companies have shut down their operations in South Korea in the past few months. Regulatory shortfalls in the country, like the lack of a request-for-proposal (RFP) system, which selects a few outstanding operators in each city to deliver the best possible micromobility services, caused rider compliance issues like parking and congestion.\u00a0Gbike has raised a total of $10 million from investors, including Mirae Asset Venture Investment, Strong Ventures and SBI Investment.Lime suspends operations in South Korea due to \u201cchaotic scooter environment\u201dSingapore-based micromobility startup Beam secures $93M Series B, enters new markets",

Well, at least for me it is.I spent a week driving the Ford F-150 Lightning (XLT, dual motor trim) and just took possession of the Rivian R1T, Adventure Launch Edition trim in compass yellow. (Both vehicles were provided by the automakers for one week and I am paying for the charging costs).I have to say that after seven days with the Lightning and two days with the Rivian, I m really bummed these automakers didn t make a vehicle together (lest you forget).Both EV trucks earn high marks in my book. Yet each automaker clearly shines in certain areas.Rivian absolutely crushes it with fun, unexpected details, and its UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) is some of the best I ve experienced. Ford simply knows how to make solid, sound and well-performing trucks at volume. The Lightning s performance, plus a few thoughtful touches, illustrates that Ford also knows its customer base.More to come on these two trucks.In the meantime, let s dig in. You ll notice lots of executive shuffling and hiring, restructuring and layoff news in this week s edition. This is not over.

        "title": "Autonomous flight startup Merlin Labs nabs $105M and US Air Force partnership",
        "text": "Autonomous flight is a grand challenge in aviation \u2014 and a gold mine. The first company to crack it at scale stands to reap handsome profits from transportation and logistics alone. In 2020, the size of the global cargo airline industry was $110.8 billion, according to Statista, and one source estimates that it ll generate hundreds of billions in revenue by 2027.Xwing is one of the startups chasing after self-flying planes, as is Reliable Robotics, Pyka\u00a0and the unicorn Volocopter. They re not the only ones. Roughly a year ago, Boston-based Merlin Labs emerged from stealth with an autonomous flight system designed to be installed in existing aircraft. While Merlin told TechCrunch at the time that it had \u201chundreds\u201d of test flights under its belt, the company s system lacked certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to provide commercial service.That changed recently. In September, Merlin achieved approval from the FAA and New Zealand s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for its \u201ccertification basis\u201d for autonomy system as part of a joint project between the FAA and CAA. Post-certification, Merlin landed partnerships with air fleet operators Dynamic Aviation and Ameriflight and branched into defense, revealing that it would supply its system to the U.S. Air Force to retrofit the service s C-130J Super Hercules cargo planes.Image Credits: Merlin LabsEvidently pleased with the progress, investors have poured significant capital into Merlin, driving the size of its Series B round to $105 million. The round, announced today, was co-led by Snowpoint and Baillie Gifford with participation from GV (formerly Google Ventures) and brings Merlin s total raised to $130 million.\u201cMerlin was founded to define what s possible in the next 100 years of aviation,\u201d CEO Matt George told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cA core part of my interest in founding Merlin is to increase pilot safety and operational flexibility by adding autonomous systems to existing aircraft.\u201dGeorge is a two-time founder, having previously launched Bridj, a platform that supports on-demand public transportation providers. Bridj gained modest traction in Boston, Washington, D.C., and Austin before it ran out of runway, selling its assets, including the brand, to Australian company Transit Systems. With Merlin, George \u2014 drawing on his experience as a pilot \u2014 hopes to make a softer landing.\u201cWe re going to continue to achieve our certification milestones \u2026 [W]e want to build on that record of trust and safety with the new funding,\u201d George said. \u201cThe business case is relatively simple: in a world of increasing transportation costs and a global shortage of pilots, autonomy can help to ease the burden of cost on companies, and at the same time can increase safety for pilots themselves, who now have an always-on, alert, and intelligent robotic co-pilot within the airframe they re already familiar with.\u201dMerlin s avionics system uses GPS, inertial navigation systems, air data, and altitude and heading reference systems to establish an aircraft s current position and altitude. The system performs actions using actuators connected to the plane, which are directed by the onboard flight computer.Flight is complex; fatal crashes like Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in 2019 are sobering reminders of this. But George argues that autonomy in the air is easier than, say, the road because ground-based radar offers \u201ccomplete vision\u201d of nearly everything in the sky \u2014 at least in the U.S. He sees Merlin s technology merely building on the autopilot systems that are ubiquitous in large commercial aircraft today, which often handle in-flight procedures as well as landing.As a fallback, pilots fly alongside Merlin s system within equipped aircraft, George says, and their data is used to improve the system s efficiency and safety.Image Credits: Merlin LabsOne particularly unique aspect of Merlin s product is its use of speech recognition to interface with air traffic controllers. As George explains, Merlin s system is designed to receive verbal instructions from control towers, recognize and interpret the instructions and adjust flight instructions accordingly. George says that the system had to be trained on a range of accents and voice types to ensure it was \u201cgenuinely robust and useful.\u201dSpeech recognition being fallible, the human pilot takes over in instances where it fails.Even with over $100 million in funding, Merlin isn t as well-financed as some of its competitors. But George claims that the startup is already generating \u201c8+ figures of revenue,\u201d which he sees as a major milestone in the nascent market.Defense is likely to be a lucrative new line of business for Merlin in light of recent geopolitical developments. One rival, Shield AI, recently raised $165 million at a $2.3 billion valuation to fuel development of its military autonomous flying systems.Fast Company previously reported that Merlin was working with the Air Force under an \u201cother transaction authority\u201d (OTA), a procurement contract in which the government funds the development of a technology until it s mature enough to fulfill the terms of a defense contract. Merlin described the amount as \u201cmuch larger\u201d than the traditional million or so dollars at which OTAs usually top out.\u201cThe autonomous flight industry, in addition to the technical challenges inherent to getting planes to fly on their own, faces challenges from regulatory and public perception \u2026 We re facing these challenges by working alongside key stakeholders to ensure a safe, measured approach to autonomous flight,\u201d George said. \u201cThe challenge the pandemic presented also serves as a demonstration of the value of what we re enabling in aviation: the pandemic fundamentally shifted ways people shop, which in turn put enormous pressure on retailers, carriers, and logistics companies to transport and deliver goods in a timely manner, and strained the aviation system in general.\u201dGeorge says that Merlin will put the money from the latest funding toward expanding testing, building a New Zealand\u2013based Part 135 freight capability, and growing its 70-person headcount across the U.S. and New Zealand. (Merlin Labs has offices in Los Angeles, Denver and New Zealand, as well as a dedicated flight facility in the Mojave Desert.) In New Zealand, Part 135 rules prescribe the operating requirements for aircraft with fewer than nine seats and helicopters.Merlin has previously said that it expects to see autonomous flights that can take off, navigate, land and converse with air traffic control as soon as 2023.",

        "title": "Wave, a Stripe-backed African fintech valued at $1.7 billion, cut 15% of its staff in June",
        "text": "Wave, an African fintech that offers mobile money services in Senegal and Ivory Coast, laid off about 15% of its workforce last month. TechCrunch first got a whiff of the layoff news on LinkedIn, where Jessica Chervin, a former Andela executive who joined Wave as an expansion lead in March, wrote that she was leaving the company.\u201cLike many tech companies, Wave is adjusting rapidly to the jarring changes in capital markets in recent months and like the best of them (and importantly, as a financial institution), it has had to make very hard calls in order to ensure that it can continue to serve customers in existing markets now and long into the future,\u201d Chervin, who is also an angel investor, wrote. \u201cThis vital shift in strategic priorities means that I and many others are leaving Wave far earlier than anyone had hoped.\u201dTechCrunch reached out to Wave for comment on the matter and a spokesperson confirmed that \u201cclose to 15%\u201d of the company s almost 2,000 staff were let go. Thus, the layoffs affected almost 300 employees, most of whom worked in Wave s new markets: Burkina Faso, Mali and Uganda.According to a statement Wave released to its employees on June 30, the company said it was scaling back its teams in these markets as part of efforts to make sure it doesn t have to depend on new funding at a time \u201cwhen investors around the world are cutting back.\u201dWave said its decision to pull out from newer markets will help it double down on Senegal and Ivory Coast, core markets \u201cwhere we are market leaders in mobile money with growing businesses,\u201d as it continues to serve its new markets.In 2020, Wave officially spun off from Sendwave, a remittance platform that WorldRemit acquired for about $500 million in cash and stock. The company, which operated a stealth launch two years prior in Senegal, has since raised more than $290 million in equity and debt capital funding to date. The firm, run by Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk, was valued at $1.7 billion at its last fundraise last September after it raised $200 million, the largest Series A in Africa. It was led by Stripe, Sequoia Heritage, Founders Fund and Ribbit Capital. The startup s other investors include Sam Altman and Partech Africa.Wave s platform is akin to PayPal (with mobile money accounts, not bank accounts). It runs an agent network that uses cash on hand to service customers who can make free deposits and withdrawals and get charged a 1% fee whenever they send money.The company is disrupting the mobile money industry dominated by banks and telcos with its app-based solution, cheaper fees and QR-based tech. And despite its continuous squabble with these incumbents due to eating into their market share, Wave claims to serve more than 10 million users monthly across its operating markets.Wave is the first unicorn out of Senegal and the overall Francophone Africa region. However, its staff cuts across its five markets, Tunisia, Kenya, the U.S., Germany, Nigeria and the U.K. The company s spokesperson said that a small percentage of the released employees operated remotely across these countries.\u201cThe people we re parting ways with are some of the smartest and most dedicated in our industry. Letting them go is one of the hardest decisions we ve ever had to make as a business,\u201d the remainder of the statement read. \u201cWe regret the impact on employees and their families, but we feel strongly that the best way to honor these colleagues is to ensure their contributions last. Wave is offering enhanced benefits and packages to all affected employees to express our deep appreciation for their valuable contributions, hard work, and dedication.\u201dAs the global venture capital market slows, Africa charts its own course10 steps for managing layoffs respectfullyLayoffs have become the norm as rising interest rates and an extended bull run that swept across private and public markets over the last couple of years, among other factors, combine to make life difficult for tech companies. Amidst recession fears, investors are being stringent with their money, mainly toward growth- and late-stage startups. As a result, startups have had to cut costs and trim down workforces to survive; those who have had some success raising capital have had to adjust to pre-pandemic valuations.Big Tech companies have fired (Microsoft) and hinted at firing (Meta) employees. Small- to large-sized startups in various sectors, such as Substack, Hopin, Coinbase, Bolt, Byju, Twitter, PayPal and Tesla, have downsized too. And though it seemed, at first, that the knock-on effect would take a considerable amount of time before reaching Africa, news of layoffs from mobility startup Swvl and healthtech company Vezeeta made the rounds last month.However, just as the situation wasn t dire for Swvl and Vezeeta, it isn t for Wave. The Senegal-based startup likely has enough money in the bank for the next few years, and last week, it secured a \u20ac90 million syndicated loan from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Lendable, Norfund and other lenders in one of the largest debt deals on the continent. The loan, Wave said, will help it increase its customer base and grow operations in Senegal and Ivory Coast.SWVL plans to lay off 32% of its team two months after going publicEgyptian healthtech startup Vezeeta cuts 10% of 500-person staffMicrosoft lays off a portion of its workforce as part of a \u2018realignment ",

It s also betting on ridable robot unicorns for kids.Xpeng Robotics, a bionic robot maker affiliated with Xpeng, just raised an impressive $100 million in a Series A round led by IDG Capital, at a time when venture investments are slowing in China.Other investors include Xpeng itself and some undisclosed backers. It s unclear how much control Xpeng has over Xpeng Robotics following the latest round. But given their shared brand association, it won t be surprising the two firms are closely tied up \u2014 at least on the development front. Technologies like autonomous driving that Xpeng has been working on are easily applicable to the robot business.Indeed, as Xpeng s chairman and CEO He Xiaopeng said in a statement:\u201cI also believe that in the future, manufacturers of smart cars will also be manufacturers of smart robots\u2026 As part of our mission as a technology innovator and explorer, we will continue to provide support to Xpeng Robotics.\u201dXpeng Robotics calls itself an \u201cecosystem company\u201d of Xpeng.Founded in 2016, Xpeng Robotics s first product is a quadruped robot that can navigate autonomously and interact with humans. In an animated 3D teaser revealed last September, the pony-like robot is seen nodding and blinking to a kid \u2014 with the kid then riding it around. In another video shot in real life, the pony is transporting snacks around an office in response to voice commands and trailing behind a human.We ve seen a variety of companion robots, like Shenzhen-based Elephant Robotics  cutesy bionic cat, but few are of the size of Xpeng Robotics s pony, which is as tall as a kid. One can imagine the R&D costs poured into finding a product-market fit for the quadruped robot and actually making it work.Six years into operation, Xpeng Robotics still has not set a delivery date for its robots, though it said in its press release that it expects \u201cintelligent robots to enter households in the next two years.\u201d The project is clearly not something that can be undertaken by a scruffy startup without the backing from a deep-pocketed patron.The funding will allow Xpeng Robotics to deepen its R&D investment in robotic hardware and software, hire \u201ctop-tier talent\u201d and accelerate product development and iteration.The startup is headquartered in the global hardware hub Shenzhen, with R&D centers in Guangzhou, Beijing and Silicon Valley.

        "text": "Global venture capital firm\u00a0Cathay Innovation has announced its third fund, targeting \u20ac1 billion ($1.05 billion) at a broad gamut of companies and technologies around the world.With Fund III, Cathay Innovation launches what will surely be one of the largest multi-stage VC funds to emerge from Europe once it closes, encompassing Series A, B, and later-stage startups. The company said that it intends to serve as lead- or co-investor, with investments ranging from $5 million to around $80 million in size.The new fund follows its $550 million second fund back in 2020, which \u2014 like the inaugural fund before that \u2014 was also a multi-stage fund. In tandem, Cathay Innovation, which is part of the broader private-equity outfit known as Cathay Capital, has also been entering vertical-specific industries, having just last month launched a new $110 million fund directed at the crypto sector. The month before that, Cathay Capital itself launched a $500 million health fund.So against a backdrop of economic downturns, startup recessions and VC trepidation, it seems that someone, somewhere at Cathay Towers may have missed the memo.\u201cDespite the current market conditions and uncertainty, we re strong believers that the digital revolution will only continue to accelerate, and that leading tech companies will do extremely well, showing strong growth and pricing power,\u201d Cathay Innovation CEO and co-founder Denis Barrier told TechCrunch. \u201cIn the next 10 years, all industries face massive change as modern digital infrastructure better links products, customer needs and the wider value chain. As a result, today s markets will be redefined and the companies who cope well with digital transformation will have the opportunity to lead much larger markets than before.\u201dCathay Innovation co-founder and CEO Denis Barrier. Image Credits: Cathay InnovationCathay Innovation s focus is about as broad as it gets, spanning just about every nook of the industrial spectrum, from fintech and mobility to retail and energy. But behind what at first might appear to be a scattergun investment ethos, there is a strategy. Businesses often have to forge relationships with complementary companies from other industries, for example as supply chain partners or even as paying customers, so by investing in such a wide range of businesses, Cathay can help build bridges across sectors.\u201cWe specifically built our funds to include a diverse ecosystem of leading multi-sector corporations as not only LPs (limited partners), but as strategic partners to help tailor our investment thesis to industries such as healthcare, finance, consumer, energy, mobility and logistics,\u201d Barrier explained. \u201cThis has several benefits, as it grants access to invaluable industry expertise and allows for cross-industry fertilization; it connects startups to potential partners or significant customers that can help them scale; and it helps boost the digital transformation efforts of our corporate partners while bringing innovation to life in real-world industries.\u201dThe core focus of the new fund will be on Series A and B rounds; however, the company said that it plans to hold enough reserves for later growth rounds, and will target investments at companies that fall under the U.N. s Sustainable Development Goals, incorporating good health and well-being; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; and climate.Global normingWhile Cathay Innovation is by no means a location-specific fund, its roots lie firmly in Europe, having initially set up shop in Paris back in 2015 where Barrier is now based. More than half of Cathay Innovation s global team \u2014 amounting to nearly 30 individuals \u2014 are also based in Europe, and more than one-third of its portfolio companies also hail from Europe.\u201cWhile we invest globally, with our marquee funds primarily covering Europe, North America and Asia, we ve always maintained a strong European presence in terms of local team, LPs and portfolio companies,\u201d Barrier said. \u201cWe ve invested in many leading European startups.\u201dCathay Innovation s Paris-based team. Image Credits: Cathay InnovationMany of these startups have gone on to achieve notable exits, including Spanish electric vehicle charging startup Wallbox, which now trades on the New York Stock Exchange, and delivery company Glovo, which was recently acquired by Delivery Hero. More broadly, Cathay Innovation has invested in 120 companies, delivering two IPOs, five acquisitions and 19 unicorns in the process.That all said, since its inception seven years ago, Cathay Innovation has expanded with new offices and teams in North America, Asia and Africa, giving the VC firm inroads into lucrative markets everywhere.\u201cWe started Cathay Innovation to back emerging startups transforming key industries and with the belief that the best innovations come from all corners of the world \u2014 which will continue with Fund III,\u201d Barrier added.",

        "title": "Leaked Uber Files reveal history of lawbreaking, lobbying and exploiting violence against drivers",
        "text": "Thousands of leaked confidential files reveal a treasure trove of sketchy and unlawful behavior from Uber. The Uber Files, which were originally shared with The Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, show a company that has knowingly broken laws, gone to extreme lengths to avoid justice, secretly lobbied governments, received aid from top politicians and exploited violence against drivers to drum up business.The damning leak of more than 124,000 documents, now known as the Uber Files, spans a five-year period between 2013 and 2017. It covers Uber s operations across 40 countries when Uber was still run by co-founder Travis Kalanick, who took an aggressive approach to bringing the ride-hailing service into cities around the world, even when doing so would break local laws and taxi regulations.Mark MacGann, a lobbyist who led Uber s push to win over governments in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, has come forward as the source who leaked the documents, according to The Guardian. He decided to speak out because he believes Uber knowingly broke laws in dozens of countries and misled people about the driver benefits of the gig worker model.\u201cI am partly responsible,\u201d MacGann told The Guardian. \u201cI was the one talking to governments, I was the one pushing this with the media, I was the one telling people that they should change the rules because drivers were going to benefit and people were going to get so much economic opportunity.\u201dThe Uber Files, which include 83,000 emails and 1,000 other files including conversations, reveal for the first time Uber s $90 million-a-year lobbying and public relations campaigns to gain the support of world leaders, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, in order to disrupt Europe s taxi industry.In a statement, Uber spokesperson Jill Hazelbaker acknowledged the many mistakes made by Uber under the stewardship of Kalanick, but that his replacement,\u00a0Dara Khosrowshahi, was \u201ctasked with transforming every aspect of how Uber operates\u201d and has \u201cinstalled the rigorous controls and compliance necessary to operate as a public company.\u201d\u201cWe have not and will not make excuses for past behavior that is clearly not in line with our present values. Instead, we ask the public to judge us by what we ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come,\u201d she said.In the past five years, the company has continued to spend millions on lobbying and marketing campaigns so it can go on treating its drivers as independent contractors, rather than employees. The company also recently shot down a shareholder proposal to gain transparency around Uber s lobbying efforts.Contrary to Hazelbaker s statement that Uber is a company reformed since 2017 \u2014 which is when Kalanick resigned as CEO amid a storm of concerns about Uber s workplace culture, including allegations of sexual harassment, racial discrimination and bullying \u2014 Uber has continued to operate its service as is, even when local laws stipulate drivers must be treated as employees. And, despite violent protests and attacks on drivers that date well beyond 2017, Uber has continued to operate in countries and cities where local regulators say drivers must have a license to operate a taxi service.Let s break down some of what s inside the Uber Files.\u2018Emmanuel  and \u2018Travis  on a first-name basisParis was the first European city that Uber launched in, and the city fought hard against the new tech company. French taxi drivers staged protests that often turned violent. But Macron, who in 2014 had just been appointed minister for the economy, thought Uber would help create new jobs and economic growth. After meeting with the company s lobbyists that October, Macron became a champion for Uber s interests within government, one who would work to rewrite laws in Uber s favor, the files show.MacGann, the whistleblower, at the time described the meeting as \u201cspectacular. Like I ve never seen,\u201d and said, \u201cLots of work to come, but we ll dance soon.\u201dMacron and Kalanick, who soon were on a first-name basis, met at least four times, according to the files, including in Paris and at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\u201cThe openness and welcome we receive is unusual in government-industry relations,\u201d Uber wrote to Macron, noting that it was \u201cextremely grateful\u201d for its kind treatment.During that year, Macron worked with Uber to rewrite France s laws governing its services. Uber had launched UberPop, a service that allowed unlicensed drivers to offer rides at a discounted price. The service was banned by the government initially, but as is Uber s way, it kept the service going as it challenged the law.\u201cUber will provide an outline for a regulatory framework for ridesharing,\u201d an email from Kalanick to Macron reads. \u201cWe will connect our respective teams to start working on a feasible proposal that could become the formal framework in France.\u201dWhen, in June 2015, the taxi driver protests became violent, Macron texted Kalanick saying that he would \u201cgather everybody next week to prepare the reform and correct the law,\u201d according to the files. On the same day, Uber suspended UberPop in France. Later that year, Macron signed off on a decree relaxing requirements for licensing Uber drivers.A spokesperson for Macron said in an email to the BBC: \u201cHis functions naturally led him to meet and interact with many companies engaged in the sharp shift which came out during those years in the service sector, which had to be facilitated by unlocking administrative and regulatory hurdles.\u201dAside from Macron, the files also reveal how Neelie Kroes, an ex-EU digital commissioner and one of Brussels  top officials, was talking to Uber about joining the company before her term ended. Kroes also apparently secretly lobbied for the firm, which potentially breaches EU ethics rules.\u2018Violence guarantees success The leaked files reveal a cache of incredibly frank and direct conversations between Kalanick and other top officials that reveal a number of unethical practices and disdain for officials who didn t commit to aiding Uber. Perhaps those that are most jarring are the ones that seem to exploit violence against drivers.In one exchange, Uber executives warned against sending drivers to a protest in France which could lead to violence from angry taxi drivers.\u201cI think it s worth it,\u201d wrote Kalanick. \u201cViolence guarantee[s] success.\u201dIn a statement, Kalanick s spokesperson said he \u201cnever suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety\u2026Any accusation that Mr. Kalanick directed, engaged in, or was involved in any of these activities is completely false.\u201dOne former senior executive told The Guardian that Uber s decision to send drivers into potentially dangerous protests, knowing the risks, was consistent with the company s strategy of \u201cweaponizing\u201d drivers and exploiting the violence to \u201ckeep the controversy burning.\u201dThe leaked emails suggest that such a strategy was repeated in Belgium, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. For example, when masked men, reportedly angry taxi drivers, attacked Uber drivers with knuckle-dusters and a hammer in Amsterdam in March 2015, Uber used the violence to try to win concessions from the Dutch government, the files show.Uber encouraged driver victims to file police reports, which were shared with leading Dutch daily newspaper De Telegraaf.\u201c[They] will be published without our fingerprint on the front page tomorrow\u201d, one manager wrote. \u201cWe keep the violence narrative going for a few days, before we offer the solution.\u201dHazelbaker acknowledged that the company had mistreated drivers in the past, but that didn t mean anyone wanted violence against them.\u201cThere is much our former CEO said nearly a decade ago that we would certainly not condone today,\u201d she said. \u201cBut one thing we do know and feel strongly about is that no one at Uber has ever been happy about violence against a driver.\u201dThe \u2018kill switch Despite Uber s public-facing mask of innocence and attempts to define angry taxi drivers and regulated taxi markets as \u201ccartels,\u201d the company appears to have known that it was operating illegally in many cities.Internal emails reveal staff referring to Uber s \u201cother than legal status,\u201d and other forms of operating services against regulations in countries including the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Turkey and Russia.One senior executive wrote in an email: \u201cWe are not legal in many countries, we should avoid making antagonistic statements.\u201d Another executive wrote: \u201cWe have officially become pirates,\u201d in response to the strategies Uber deployed to \u201cavoid enforcement.\u201dA message to a colleague in 2014 by Nairi Hourdajian, Uber s head of global communications, even went so far as to say: \u201cSometimes we have problems because, well, we re just fucking illegal.\u201dRegulatory agencies, police and transport officials around the world worked to clamp down on Uber. Some officials would download the app and hail rides so they could pull sting operations on unlicensed taxi journeys and fine Uber or impound drivers  cars. Offices in dozens of countries were raided by authorities.That s where the \u201ckill switch\u201d came in. If law enforcement came to access the company s computers, Uber would activate a \u201ckill switch\u201d that would restrict officers  access to sensitive company data like lists of drivers, which Uber thought would harm its growth.The files reveal that Kalanick asked staffers to hit the kill switch \u201cASAP\u201d in Amsterdam at least once, according to an email from his account. They also reveal that this technique, which Uber s lawyers and regulatory departments vetted and signed off on, was used at least 12 times during raids in Belgium, France, India, Hungary, the Netherlands and Romania.Kalanick s spokesperson said in a statement that such protocols are common business practice that protect intellectual property and customer privacy, and are not designed to obstruct justice. She also noted that Kalanick \u201chas never been charged in any jurisdiction for obstruction of justice or any related offense.\u201d(Kalanick\u00a0has\u00a0been charged in the past on allegations that he paid hackers $100,000 to cover up a heist that stole personal information from about 57 million of Uber s users and drivers in 2016.)Text messages and emails between executives detail multiple other instances in which Uber used the kill switch. For example, in March 2015 in Uber s Paris office, a \u201cbig force (around 25)\u201d of police officers showed up and were \u201ctrying to get into laptops,\u201d according to an email from then-lobbyist MacGann to David Plouffe, former Obama aide who joined Uber as head of global branding, communications and policy the year prior.\u201cAccess to IT tools was cut immediately, so the police won t be able to get much if anything,\u201d MacGann told Plouffe.In July that year, messages between MacGann and Thibaud Simphal, then-manager of France and now-head of Uber s global sustainability unit, offer a particularly revealing exchange.\u201cUse the \u2018Zachary De Kievit  playbook:\u201d he wrote, referencing an Uber attorney. \u201cTry a few laptops, appear confused when you cannot get access, say that IT team is in SF and fast asleep, and anyway this is all controlled by UberBV so they should write to Uber BV with their request. Zac can give a signed copy of his book.\u201dSimphal s response: \u201cOh yeah we ve used that playbook so many times by now the most difficult part is continuing to act surprised!\u201dThis story has been updated with details from the whistleblower, Mark MacGann.",

        "text": "It is worth beginning with a note that I am terribly risk averse, and therefore \u2026 not a ton of fun. When Ford micromobility subsidiary Spin\u00a0first launched a fleet of electric scooters in my hometown of Pittsburgh last summer, my immediate instinct was very old-man-yells-at-cloud.Youths took over the streets and sidewalks, racing around downtown and the North Shore on the orange scooters. In the hillier parts of the city \u2014 in case you don t know anything about Pittsburgh, that s most of the city \u2014 they were a stationary menace, abandoned on sidewalks, under bridges and in the middle of alleys.I wrote off the Spin scooters as an inevitable consequence of city living and vowed to avoid the cursed conveyances. Around the same time, two things happened: I started editing a lot of Rebecca Bellan s contributions to TechCrunch, and I began dating a guy who swears scooters are fun.Founders of micromobility startups made plenty of good arguments for why fleets of electric scooters and bikes make sense. First and foremost, they are not cars, which is great for improving air quality and ameliorating rush-hour traffic. They can aid in solving the \u201clast-mile problem\u201d \u2014 getting people from the last stop on the subway or bus line to their home or work. They re in theory more affordable than owning a car or even hailing a taxi or an Uber, solving obvious equity issues for low-income individuals.I wasn t buying it \u2014 they struck me as dangerous, rickety and unsustainable on multiple levels. Venture capitalists disagreed, dumping millions into the likes of Bird and Lime.If you ve been reading TechCrunch, you know what happened next.",

There s a lot of fintech news out there and it s my job to stay on top of it \u2014 and make sense of it \u2014 so you can stay in the know. \u2014\u00a0Mary AnnLayoffs up in H1 2022In 2021, fintech startups were the top recipients of venture capital globally, accounting for about 21% of dollars raised with $131.5 billion across 4,969 deals. So far in 2022, fintech startups are earning another, less favorable distinction \u2014 accounting for the third largest number of layoffs, by percentage, globally.As of July 1, some 3,709 employees \u2014 excluding crypto companies \u2014 have been laid off across 41 \u201clayoff events\u201d in the second quarter of 2022, according to an analysis by Roger Lee of Layoffs.fyi. For context, that is 3,709 out of 36,861 startup employees laid off overall during Q2, meaning that fintech accounted for 10.1% of the total. Based on that categorization, the fintech space ranked third behind food and transportation, respectively. However, the site classified companies such as Better.com in the \u201cReal Estate\u201d category. So if you include that company s layoffs \u2014 which amounted to some 3,000 in the first quarter of 2022 \u2014 the fintech numbers inch up even higher and fintech becomes the category that saw the most layoffs by percentage \u2014 15.4% \u2014 in the first half of 2022.Notably, in all of 2020, 8,715 employees in fintech were laid off. And there are surely far more fintechs around today than there were back then. In 2020, fintech trailed behind the transportation and travel categories when it came to layoffs as percentage of the total, Lee told TechCrunch via email.Remarkably, ZERO employees in fintech were laid off in the entirety of 2021, according to Lee s analysis.In summary, 4,189 fintech employees were let go across 45 events in the first half of 2022; this number is out of 46,740 startup employees laid off overall, making up 11.2% of the total. That compares to 8,375 in the first half of 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.Klarna s cutting of 700 employees, or 10% of its staff, and Robinhood s layoff of 300 workers were among the largest layoff events in the second quarter.Please note that it s important to keep in mind that there were most certainly other layoff events that were not recorded here, so the true numbers are likely even higher.Layoffs are incredibly difficult for those workers affected, those left behind and for the companies themselves. But as we ve seen over time, some companies do a better job of handling them than others. I thought this post by Latitud co-founder Brian Requarth summed it up well: \u00a0\u201cLayoffs are hard and I don t want to diminish that, but most likely the talent will get redistributed quickly. If you lost your job, hang in there. If you had to let people go, the most important thing is to treat those people well. Not just because it s the right thing to do, but because you are sending a message to those people that are staying with you.\u201dWeekly NewsReinventionBoth Bolt and Better (how s that for alliteration) have been the subject of (many) negative headlines in recent months. To say that their reputations have taken a beating is an understatement. Well, coincidentally this week, both companies shared some news in clear attempts to improve their tarnished reputations. In what many viewed as a head-scratching turn of events, one-click checkout Bolt ended up settling with a retail giant ABG Group and making it a shareholder. After the latter made so many disparaging remarks about the former, one might question why it would want to own a stake in the company. It kinda doesn t make sense, although Insider speculated this year that was ABG s goal with the litigation to begin with. Still, I had a good conversation with Bolt s CEO and former Amazon exec Maju Kuruvilla, and the biggest takeaways were (1) the company is on a mission to grow more responsibly, having shed some jobs in Q2 and \u201creally doubling down on things that are a core value proposition\u201d; (2) Bolt says it now has 3 years of operating runway, which, if true, is impressive; and (3) while its revenues seemed to be far lower than might be expected for an $11 billion company, Bolt s not giving up and the settlement of this case can definitely be seen as a win, even if it s a bit confusing.In the case of Better.com, the embattled digital mortgage lender revealed a string of new senior executive hires that quite frankly were mind-boggling. They include former execs from companies such as Zillow, Casper and LendingTree, among others. I did not speak to Better CEO Vishal Garg but he did provide a canned statement conveying his excitement about all the new folks \u2014 who come on board after a flurry of senior exec departures and amid a tumultuous environment. It s fascinating that so many people are willing to take a bet on Better after everything that has happened since December 1. Is the company truly turning itself around? We ll see.A couple of years back, I did a deep dive on Atlanta s startup scene and was startled to see how robust it was. Last week, Protocol s Veronica Irwin examined the Southern city with a fintech lens, writing: \u201cSan Francisco has Square, Stripe and Plaid. But Atlanta has CoreCard, Kabbage and CheckFree. It also lays claim to pioneering charge cards, electronic payments and ATMs. Many of the everyday innovations in fintech we ve come to rely on have the Atlanta metropolitan area to thank.\u201dOther NewsPreliminary numbers confirm what we all already know: Investing in the world of fintech has slowed down. Steve McLaughlin, managing partner at Financial Technology Partners (also known as FT Partners) posted on LinkedIn that \u201cfinancing activity slowed notably compared to Q1 and the year ago period, but activity remained quite robust when compared to any other period besides 2021; activity did appear to wane as the quarter progressed.\u201d For example, in the second quarter, total dollar volume raised by private fintech companies globally reached $27.5 billion, down 27% compared to Q1 and down 31% compared to the year ago period. Still, Q2 was above every quarter prior to 2021.These days, it s rare for a week to go by without some layoffs hitting the sector. Last week, Brazilian proptech startup Loft announced it let go of 380 employees, or 12% of its workforce. Earlier this year, it had laid off 159 people. In an emailed statement, Loft described the move as \u201ca reorganization of its operation.\u201d It s clear that LatAm is not immune to the housing market downturn in the face of rising interest rates, among other things.Two big names in fintech partnered up last week. London-based Revolut said it is working with Stripe (which started in Ireland) to support payments in the U.K. and Europe and \u201caccelerate its expansion into new markets.\u201d Specifically, Revolut will facilitate payments through Stripe s existing infrastructure.Image Credits: patpitchaya / Getty ImagesFundings and M&ADeal of the WeekEl Salvador\u2013based fintech n1co (read: nee-koh) has raised $12 million at a post\u2013money valuation of $64.8 million, in what it describes as a historic pre-seed round for the region. The fintech company was started by the same founders as Hugo \u2014 a super app that recently sold to Delivery Hero for $150 million \u2014 Alejandro Argumedo, Ricardo Cuellar and Juan Maceda.Alejandro McCormack tells TechCrunch he was invited to join the trio as a co-founder and is serving as COO/interim CEO due to his previous experience at N26 and Raisin. He said the original founding trio was \u201conce again betting on a region that is usually forgotten in the tech landscape.\u201d Focused on the payments space, n1co says it has already signed up over 1,000 merchants who are now accepting credit and debit card payments using n1co s technology, specifically QR codes, payment links and online storefront processing. With almost $1 million monthly transaction volume across five countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Dominican Republic), McCormack shared via email that n1co will be using the fresh capital to accelerate growth (currently 30% MoM), develop its POS devices and push its soon-to-be-launched current account and Visa debit card.With the rollout of the n1co card, the company believes it will be positioned as the first neobank focused on Central America and the Dominican Republic \u2014 a region with roughly 55 million people. \u201cThis represents a larger addressable market than Colombia, with lower banking penetration, and an average of around 1.5 smartphones per adult,\u201d McCormack added.Interestingly, the startup decided to forgo the typical VC route during its raise, instead focusing on regional groups that it believes will add value to its business model, including the largest gas station operators in the region, one of the largest supermarket chains and other large regional retail groups. \u201cIn total they have around $1.4 billion in card transaction volume per year \u2014 volume which they have committed to processing with n1co,\u201d McCormack said.Image Credits: n1coSeen on TechCrunchPeakflo s bid to build business payments for Southeast Asia attracts capital, customersUK-based YuLife picks up $120M at an $800M valuation as it expands its gamified, wellness-focused approach to life insurancea16z leads $6.5M seed round for Adaptive, a construction software and fintech play.

        "text": "It s a long road taking an idea from the R&D stage in a lab to successful commercialization, especially when you re talking about technologies as complex and costly as robotics and artificial intelligence.Robotics startups require expensive equipment \u2014 like industrial-grade sensors, 3D printers and controlled environments \u2014 for building and testing prototypes. And even though robotics is weathering the current slowdown in venture funding better than other tech sectors, it s still too easy for innovative inventions to remain stuck in the lab.That s why we re thrilled to welcome three experts in the process to TC Sessions: Robotics on July 21: Pieter Abbeel, co-founder and chief scientist at Covariant; Joyce Sidopoulos, co-founder and VP of programs and community at MassRobotics; and Milo Werner, general partner at The Engine.In a session entitled \u201cFrom Cage to Stage: Commercializing AI and Robotics,\u201d the panel will share their considerable experience in what it takes to move a robot or AI process from the lab to market.Here s what our panelists bring to the table, and why we can t wait to get their take on the topic.In addition to founding Covariant, which develops AI for robotic automation of warehouses and factories, Pieter Abbeel is the director of the Berkeley Robot Learning Lab and co-director of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence (BAIR) Lab.A founding partner at AIX Ventures, a VC firm focused on AI startups, Abbeel also hosts The Robot Brains podcast, which explores what AI and robotics can do today and where they are headed.Abbeel s work has been featured in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, BBC, Rolling Stone, Wired, Tech Review and (of course) TechCrunch.As the co-founder and vice president for programs and community at MassRobotics \u2014 whose mission is to enable and grow the next generation of robotics companies \u2014 Joyce Sidopoulos develops high-impact programs for the robotics ecosystem. She matches startups with potential funders and customers, connects students and talent to potential employers and works with academia to commercialize research.Previously, Sidopoulos served as the innovation and robotics community manager for the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council to expand the robotics ecosystem in Massachusetts and the New England region, which helped lead to the founding of MassRobotics.Sidopoulos spent 14 years with the USN s Naval Undersea Warfare Center, where she served in various roles, including chief scientist, systems and test engineer and sonar systems analyst/engineer. She has held senior roles at General Dynamics and other defense contractors.Milo Werner is a general partner at The Engine, a VC firm that helps deep tech companies bridge the gap between discovery and commercialization. Previously, she was a partner at Ajax Strategies where she led midstage investments across energy, transportation, agriculture and industrial applications.At Tesla, Werner led the new product introduction team and helped launch the Model S powertrain and Model X. She also ran the new product introduction team at Fitbit, and she led engineering and product development at Zola, a microgrid startup providing distributed energy to families in Sub-Saharan Africa.Werner earned a BS in Geology and Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Vermont, an MS in Civil Engineering and an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.TC Sessions: Robotics is a free online event, happening July 21.

        "title": "Traba raises $20M to match contractors with events and warehouse work",
        "text": "Traba, a jobs board designed to help entry-level workers find available shifts at fulfillment centers and event venues, today announced that it raised $20 million in a Series A round. Khosla led the financing with participation from Founders Fund, General Catalyst, SciFi VC and Atomic, valuing Traba at $120 million post-money.CEO Mike Shebat says that his experience as a warehouse manager at McMaster-Carr, an Illinois-based industrial supply company, inspired him to co-found Traba in 2021. In an interview with TechCrunch, he pointed out that staffing for warehouses remains notoriously challenging, with annual turnover rates exceeding 40%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Seventy-three percent of warehouse operators responding to one recent survey say that they can t find enough labor.After a one-and-a-half-year stint at McMaster-Carr, Shebat joined Uber, where he was a founding member of the budding UberEats division. He met Traba s second co-founder, Akshay Buddiga, through OnDeck, an online entrepreneurship bootcamp. Buddiga was previously a product operations analyst at Zenefits and a senior engineering manager at Fanatics, the sportswear retailer.\u00a0\u201cDuring the pandemic, a lot of changes happened on a macro level that made Traba s creation the perfect timing \u2026 Deemed \u2018essential workers  during the pandemic, warehouse workers finally experienced what increased flexibility looked like and want to return to the workforce with more flexibility, pay transparency and quality work,\u201d Shebat said. \u201cDuring economic crisis and recessions, warehouses have even more uncertainty on their order volume. Cash-constrained and risk averse, they have a hard time predicting full-time workforce needs. Therefore, they start relying on temp labor more so than they do when they can predict order volume and customer behavior.\u201dTraba connects workers \u2014 who must submit to a background check, powered by Checkr \u2014 with open shifts at distribution centers, warehouses and event venues. Contractor profiles allow workers to upload work histories and certifications and view their ratings and reviews; employers using Traba can rate workers and vice versa.Image Credits: TrabaShebat said Traba lightly vets hirerers. In addition, company ratings are the platform s attempt to shield workers from bad actors particularly in the warehouse industry, which tends to be accident-prone. The injury rate among warehouse workers is estimated to be 5.1 per 100 full-time workers, one of the highest of any profession.\u201cEven though this is very entry-level work, where most workers are making minimum wage in their alternative jobs, we have a $13 minimum wage on our platform. The range is $13 per hour to $38 per hour \u2014 $16 was the average wage last month,\u201d Shebat said. \u201cBy Traba requiring a minimum wage of $13, it self-vets for hirers that tend to treat workers better. We have also turned away or \u2018fired  companies that do not have proper standards, like having no A/C in a hot warehouse or complaints of abusive supervisors. We do a lot of work to ensure that they are getting amazing workers so we want to also ensure the worker has a great experience.\u201dOn Traba, workers can find shifts based on their preferred types of work, locations, transportation modes and hours. Companies only pay for the shifts filled by the platform.\u201cThe biggest value-add for the technical decision-maker is automation,\u201d Shebat said. \u201cCurrently, the process of managing a staffing agency relationship requires a lot of manual work \u2014 paper timesheets need to be filed and cross-checked against the agency invoice, the invoice needs to be filed with accounting and then paid, and there s little reporting visibility for decision makers. With Traba, time tracking is done in the worker app, meaning timesheets are automatically updated and visible in the business app immediately after the shift, and invoices are generated from these timesheets after business approval.\u201dShebat spotlighted Traba s recently introduced instant payments feature, which doles out payments to workers  bank accounts or debit cards in as little as 15 minutes after a shift. Another new capability, \u201cfavorites-first\u201d or \u201cfavorites-only,\u201d enables businesses to post shifts that give priority access to workers who ve proven themselves in the past, he explained.\u00a0When asked who he sees as Traba s chief rivals, Shebat listed some of the major staffing firms in the U.S.: Allegis, Randstad, Adecco and TrueBlue. He s not ignorant of rivals in the tech sector, either \u2014 Wonolo and Instawork being among them. Shiftsmart, one of the larger players in the space, raised $95 million in December on the back of a network of 500,000 contractors.\u00a0Broadly speaking, startups focused on hourly workers have received investor attention lately.\u00a0When I Work, Fountain, Seasoned, Homebase and Workiz raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture financing combined within the last year. That s not to suggest gig marketplaces are a surefire hit \u2014 Jyve, which connected gig economy workers with retailers, shut down last August after raising $35 million. But there s plenty in the way of capital \u2014 and competition.It remains to be seen whether that ll change in light of economic headwinds. But Shebat argues that Traba is well-positioned for growth regardless. Annualized revenue stands at over $1 million in eight months of operation with 12,000 workers on the platform, and he expects revenue to increase 5x over the next year. On the roadmap is expanding Traba s 22-person workforce to 50 by the end of the year.\u00a0\u201cWe plan to geographically expand \u2026 primarily to Texas and other light-industrial states [and] grow the sales organization,\u201d Shebat said. \u201cWe re also creating several new product releases to improve our worker app, business app and backend tools \u2014 primarily dynamic pricing, communications tools between worker and business, automations for efficiency gains and financial solutions to workers.\u201dThe Series A brings Traba s total raised to date to $23.6 million.",

        "text": "Automotive e-commerce company Autochek has expanded to new markets in Africa after acquiring CoinAfrique, a classified ad marketplace, nearly two months after the Nigerian startup acquired Moroccan auto marketplace KIFAL Auto, marking its foray into North Africa.Autochek said it will tap CoinAfrique s regional customer base in Francophone Africa to accelerate its car financing services. The classified ad marketplace is said to attract 60,000 new ads and 1.5 million visits every month, with the car category accounting for 50% of the business transactions happening on the site.Autochek is also riding on the growing automotive market in Africa, whose value is expected to hit $42 billion in the next five years \u2014 registering a compound annual growth rate of 5.5% over 2022-2027.CoinAfrique, whose team will join Autochek and help them run operations in the region, was founded in 2016 by Matthias Papet and Eric Genetre.\u201cWe see many opportunities to unlock value for users across all the categories on our platform and to expand into new countries, and we are looking forward to leveraging Autochek s market leading loans product and expertise to deliver more transformative experiences for our users,\u201d said Papet in a statement.Autochek expands to North Africa after acquiring Morocco s Kifal AutoAlready, Autochek has rolled out its operations in Ivory Coast and Senegal following the acquisition, with more markets set to be activated, including Benin and Togo, as the auto marketplace expands. CoinAfrique classifieds ads marketplace is active in 12 Francophone markets. Autochek was previously present in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Uganda and Morocco.In its current markets, Autochek said, it has more than 1,500 dealers as partners, and works closely with more than 70 banks, including BNP Paribas, Access Bank, Ecobank, UBA, Bank of Africa and NCBA Bank to offer financing to its customers.Cars listed on the site go through various stages of inspection and are rated according to their status and performance, factors also used to determine if they qualify to be financed.Autochek co-founder and CEO Etop Ikpe said in a previous interview: \u201cThe assessments and some algorithmic checks on Autochek s system help to give a sense of the status and condition of the car, determining whether it is in a state to be financed \u2026 because they (banks) do not want a situation where they finance a car and the next day, the engine knocks.\u201dAutochek said its loans are approved in about 48 hours. The company earns by charging a fee to dealers listing on its platforms, in addition to a loan facilitation commission from banks.The company, which in October last year raised $13.1 million in a seed round, is backed by a number of investors, including pan-African VC firms TLcom Capital, 4DX Ventures, Golden Palm Investments, Enza Capital, Lateral Capital, Norrsken22, Jam Fund, ASK Capital and Mobility 54 Investment SAS, the venture capital arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group.New report examines Africa s growth in the digital economy and VC investment landscapeTLcom and 4DX drive $13.1M seed round to scale Autochek s platform across Africa",

        "text": "To get a roundup of TechCrunch s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, subscribe here.Guess who s back? Back again? Well, me after a long weekend, but also Elon Musk is tweeting again, and he has lots of thoughts about socks. My partner in crime, Haje, remains in an undesirable newsletter time zone but will be back later this week. I want to call out some things going on with TechCrunch. One is that TechCrunch Live s weekly event series is new and improved, so learn more and register. Most of us here at TechCrunch spend our days on WordPress, and the Found team spoke to Matt Mullenweg, CEO of its parent company Automattic, for the latest podcast. \u2014 ChristineThe TechCrunch Top 3Just a Glance: Manish wrote two of our top stories. The first is a scoop he got related to Glance, which is reportedly launching its lock screen content platform for Android in the U.S. in the next couple of months. He also dug into Twitter s lawsuit against the Indian government that was prompted by content takedown orders. This is just another in a long line of troubles the company has had in this country.No slowdown in climate tech: Paul reports on Climentum Capital s philosophy behind its new $157 million fund that will go into European startups helping reduce CO2 emissions.We gotta figure out our \u2018exit scratgety : You ll have to go way back into the SNL archives to find that reference, but this is the first of two Haje public announcements for our founder friends. He says you really don t need that \u201cexit plan\u201d slide in your pitch deck \u2014 there are a lot of assumptions and predictions on a founder s part, and it is hard to know who wants to buy your company, so just get rid of it.Startups and VCThere are a number of very good TechCrunch+ stories today. I recommend starting with Alex s item on raising sweet capital in a sour market, where essentially he says venture capital firms should put their money to use when they can get more out of it. Then follow with his story from yesterday that does a bit more diving into 2021 company valuations.Speaking of putting capital to use in easier ways, some VC firms continue to raise funds, and Sequoia Capital has been very busy. Rita reports that Sequoia s China unit took in $9 billion, coming at a time when, she writes, \u201cglobal investors are reevaluating risks in China amid a COVID-hit economy and an ongoing regulatory crackdown on the country s internet upstarts.\u201d This complements a quick hit I did last week about Sequoia raising two funds stateside.Meanwhile, Haje s other public service announcement for today is a reminder that not all of us comprehend at the same level, so startup founders should work to attract more bees with simple honey sentences rather than big, complicated fly ones.Here s what else you might like today:Show me the money: Kyle reports on Tesorio, which closed on a $17 million Series B to continue developing tools to help businesses automate their payment collection process.The opposite of McHard is McEasy: In this case, McEasy is digitizing Indonesia s logistics, transportation and supply chain industries, and Catherine writes about the company s plans now that it has $6.5 million in new funding.Drink up: I reported on Maolac, an Israeli food tech company that is putting $3.2 million of new capital to work in its protein technology that is taking bovine colostrum and making a superfood for adults.If you like it, then you should have put a ring on it: Natasha takes us on a delightful journey looking at Ultrahuman s new smart ring aimed at \u201cdecoding metabolic health.\u201dA \u201cQuantum Leap\u201d indeed: Ingrid writes about the U.K. s Oxford Quantum Circuits, which raised $47 million for its quantum-computing-as-a-service that runs a 3D processor architecture called Coaxmon.Drive time: Rebecca interviews Veo s Candice Xie about the e-scooter company s steady journey toward profitability.Without a clear ask, your pitch deck is uselessImage Credits: Haje Jan Kamps (opens in a new window)Fundraising is difficult because most people don t have any experience asking strangers for money.The \u201cask\u201d slide where founders explain how they ll spend investors  money is particularly challenging. To break through the mental barrier, Haje recommends starting out with metrics and milestones.How much will you increase MAU or lower CAC? What are your target dates for expanding in new markets?\u201cThe more specific your goals are, the easier it is to know whether you re trending toward them,\u201d writes Haje.Without a clear ask, your pitch deck is useless(TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead. You can sign up here.)Big Tech Inc.Some big news from yesterday was that Meta decided not to move forward with its crypto payments wallet, Novi, Natasha writes. The company isn t getting rid of it completely, so stay tuned as to how it might be repurposed.Meanwhile, Google is doing a little postponing of its own \u2014 with KakaoTalk updates on its Play Store. Kate reports this has something to do with the messaging app refusing to remove its own payment links. You might remember, but Google doesn t like that.Over in Europe, we have a trio of regulation stories. First is Natasha s about the European Parliament giving its approval to a set of regulations regarding digital businesses. Then Paul writes about the U.K. pushing to make \u201cforeign interference,\u201d particularly Russian information, an offense under its proposed Online Safety Bill. Finally, Ingrid reports on the U.K. signing its first data-sharing deal since Brexit with South Korea.Take a peek at some others:Those are some big lenses you have: If you like smartphones with giant camera lenses, then you will love Haje s report on Xiaomi s new phone.\u00a0A marriage made in drone heaven: Brian writes about American Robotics  owner acquiring Airobotics and why it s a good fit.Talk about your front desk fail: WeWork India was found to have exposed the personal information and selfies of visitors, Zack writes.Fire up those engines: Rebecca listened in on Tata Motors  shareholder meeting and found that the Indian automaker aims to sell 50,000 electric vehicles by March 31, 2023.\u00a0Live commerce no more: TikTok is reportedly pulling the plug on plans to expand its live e-commerce unit, TikTok Shop, in the U.S. and some parts of Europe, Aisha writes. It will be interesting to see if live commerce ever does become a thing over in this part of the world.",

        "text": "When you think about shared micromobility, Veo isn t exactly the first company that comes to mind. It s not as widespread as competitors like Voi, Tier and Lime, and it hasn t raised nearly as much in venture capital. But as consolidation and, simply put, bad business shapes the industry, Veo has maintained a steady and profitable pace. That is, if CEO and co-founder Candice Xie is to be believed.Veo, which is perhaps most noted for its comfortable sit-down scooters and its continued presence in New York City s e-scooter pilot, has stuck by a business model that looks at micromobility more as a utility and less as a startup. Rather than raising tons of money to expand as quickly as possible in the hope of achieving favorable unit economics, Veo has slowly focused on being sustainable, one city at a time. In June 2021, Veo was in 22 markets. Today, it s added another 27, bringing it up to 49 cities, almost all of which are exclusive or limited vendor contracts. \u201cI m truly a believer that this industry takes time to build, and whoever survives is the most important thing. Long term, who can weather all the crazy market turbulence?\u201dVeo CEO Candice XieWhile VCs might shudder at such apparently slow growth \u2014 Lime s global city count is around 225 \u2014 Xie says Veo is on track to maintain a sustainable business that continues to turn over profits.We sat down with Xie one year after our initial interview to talk about what is going on with all these layoffs, why scooter ADAS isn t all it s cracked up to be and how a sustainable financial base can help startups weather market turmoil.The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.",

They then identified that bovine colostrum is one of those \u201cother sources\u201d that has over 400 homolog proteins with over 95% biosimilarity with human breast milk.Colostrum is a nutrient-rich substance that is present in the milk of mammals for the first few days after giving birth. It is often discarded at dairies, which accounts for more than 5 billion liters of waste per year, Ashkenazi Otmazgin said.She also touts that the company is the first to \u201cidentify and extract the functional proteins from bovine colostrum\u201d and make functional milk protein mixtures from that colostrum, using a proteomics discovery platform and computational biology that could be used for different immune-boosting applications.The milk protein mixture looks like a white powder that is digested in the human body similarly to breast milk and is suitable to add to food, even cooked foods like pasta, without losing functionality, Ashkenazi Otmazgin added.Maolac s mixture was also proven to produce higher overall efficacy at lower dosages. Competitors in the space are charging $500 per kilogram, and Ashkenazi Otmazgin says her company will charge similar for its product, but Maolac can deliver better efficacy at a fraction of the unit economics.Maolac is pre-revenue at this point and working on its first product line of anti-inflammatory aids, one for athletes to reduce muscle strain and improve recovery time, and one to improve elderly mobility.Is cell-cultured meat ready for prime time?Ashkenazi Otmazgin expects these products to hit the market in 2023. She also claims the market potential for functional ingredients is huge, about $22 billion per year.Helping to accelerate the products is a new $3.2 million seed round that was closed in January. OurCrowd led the investment and was joined by the Strauss Group s Kitchen FoodTech Hub, the Food Tech Lab, Ventures Israel, NAOMI Investments and Mediterranean Towers Ventures. The investment boosts the company s total funding to just over $4 million.\u201cThe idea of transforming the first, nutrient-rich milk of cows that have just given birth into a source for human protein is a stroke of pure genius,\u201d OurCrowd CEO Jon Medved said in a written statement. \u201cBillions of liters of bovine colostrum are discarded each year. Maolac takes this waste and creates a product of huge potential benefit to millions at a time when the world is desperately searching for new sustainable sources of protein. The company is a perfect example of the circular economy in action.\u201dThe new funding enables Maolac to build a pilot facility that will feature small-scale production capabilities of about 100 kilograms per month and create analytics and samples for customers and clinical trials. Ashkenazi Otmazgin also plans to add to the company s team of 12 employees.In addition, the company is currently working on getting regulatory approval in both the U.S. and Europe and is in discussions with food and supplement companies in Israel and dairy companies around the world.Investors salivate over food tech companies perfecting precision fermentation",

        "text": "In Indonesia, many logistics providers still use old-fashioned systems to track their operations and fleets, including pen-and-paper ledgers. McEasy wants to change that. The startup, which develops software-as-a-service solutions for the logistics and supply chain industry, has raised $6.5 million in Series A funding led by East Ventures.The startup was founded in 2017 by Raymond Sutjiono and Hendrik Ekowaluyo, and now serves more than 200 clients, including Cleo Pure Water, KMDI Logistics, MGM Bosco Logistics, Rosalia Indah and the Tanto Intim Line.Its software and smart tracker, called Vehicle Smart Management System, has been adopted by users like passenger buses, freight forwarding services and refrigerated vehicles used to transport pharmaceuticals, meat, seafood, dairy and frozen foods. Other products include Mobility Software-as-a-Service to digitize vehicles for real-time tracking, solutions for improving business efficiency and an open API ecosystem.The new capital will be used on developing products for SMEs and establishing a stronger foothold in Indonesia s Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. McEasy says it has grown more than 12x in the past 18 months.Sutjiono told TechCrunch that he met and became best friends with Ekowaluyo while both were studying mechanical engineering at Purdue University. The two then worked at Ford in structural engineering. Sutjiona said Ekowaluyo is an expert in structural design and program management in cars, while he focuses more on engine electronics, system control and data handling.Deliveree is smoothing Southeast Asia s bumpy logistics landscapeAfter returning to Indonesia, the two started McEasy to produce hybrid motorcycles. But after researching the market, they realized the market was shifting to digital instead of hybrid bikes, so they came up with a smart tracker for motorcycles. But because the trackers were cost-prohibitive, they decided to do another shift to B2B logistics and automotive.\u201cB2B logistics players were still using the conventional method, and we wanted to make a digital solution to improve the business process,\u201d said Sutjiono. The logistics sector was chosen because of its promising potential and growth during the pandemic. Indonesia has more than 22.5 million units of passenger vehicles and more than 5 million units of freight cars.The founders say that more than 85% of businesses in the transportation and supply chain sectors still use paper ledgers for their operations, including managing drivers, expenses, fuel consumption and route efficiency. To convince people to move from their legacy systems to McEasy, it offers free trials and is growing its operations through word of mouth.In a prepared statement, East Ventures co-founder Willson Cuaca said, \u201cMcEasy has managed to accelerate positively in this post-pandemic environment. They combine the best of both worlds \u2014 logistics and technology \u2014 to elevate their offerings, strengthen their national footprints, and maintain profitability levels.\u201dHow to keep your development team aligned with the company s product vision",

        "title": "Onomondo secures cash to expand its wireless network for IoT devices",
        "text": "Onomondo, a startup offering a dedicated wireless network for internet of things (IoT) devices, today announced that it raised $21 million in a funding round led by Verdane with participation from Maersk Growth, People Ventures and The Danish Growth Fund. In an email, CEO Michael Karlsen told TechCrunch that the new cash will be put toward productization, go-to-market efforts and marketing as Onomondo scales its team from 50 people to around 100 by the end of the year.Karlsen co-founded Onomondo in 2012 alongside Henrik Aagaard with the goal of, in Karlsen s words, \u201cexpanding the capabilities of what a network can solve for IoT.\u201d Onomondo built a wireless network for IoT devices on the back of hundreds of cellular providers that operates in over 180 countries.Prior to co-launching Onomondo, Karlsen was the CFO at indie game studio Playdead and co-founded Tel42, a Danish network wholesaler on the Danish Telenor network. Aagaard was the CTO at Tel42 until it was acquired by IoT services provider Greenwave Systems.\u201cOur solution is unique to the market as \u2026 we ve built and operate our own network core from the ground up, which offers end-to-end control and visibility from any cellular antenna across the world to any cloud,\u201d Karlsen told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cWe have built an IoT tech stack with a set of unique power tools on top, which makes the service fundamentally different from anything else available on the market today.\u201dImage Credits: OnomondoA network reserved for IoT devices isn t a novel concept. London-based FloLive built a cloud-based solution to stitch together private, local cellular networks for IoT connectivity. Helium and Kepler Communications eschewed cellular for other technologies, such as miniature satellites and \u201cLongFi,\u201d to help IoT devices talk to each other. Major players like Comcast,\u00a0SoftBank,\u00a0Orange,\u00a0SKT,\u00a0KPN,\u00a0Swisscom, Verizon and Vodafone were at one point creating or maintaining nationwide IoT networks, as well, not to mention Amazon and Samsung.Dedicated IoT networks offer several advantages over traditional cellular, Karlsen argues. For example, mobile phone networks aren t typically battery-efficient because devices on the network must communicate frequently with cell towers. By contrast, networks like Onomondo are optimized for long-range data transfers and very low power consumption, and \u2014 at least in Onomondo s case \u2014 only charge for data when devices are active.\u201cThe IoT market has almost been conditioned to think of connectivity as something that needs to be designed around and \u2018made to fit,  which has become the status quo and normalized,\u201d Karlsen said. \u201cSo, when we tell our customers they can also use the network to double their devices  lifetime, half battery consumption, lower data consumption by 90%, drive down debugging time, cut costs and increase stability with nothing but a network change, that s when people really start to listen and realize the power that lies in controlling the full network architecture and tailoring that to IoT.\u201dWhen a customer installs one of Onomondo s SIM cards in their IoT devices, information about each device is sent to the cloud. As the devices move from one country to the next, the platform automatically routes the connection through the local network infrastructure. The device doesn t need to update itself or share sensitive data with local networks, and the device owner stays in control, Karlsen claims.P\u00e5l Malmros, a partner at Verdane, said that companies in \u201casset-rich\u201d industries like transport, manufacturing and logistics are the target for Onomondo s technology. \u201c[These industries] have long attempted to harness IoT to manage supply chains, improve automation, and drive efficiency,\u201d he told TechCrunch in an email Q&A. \u201cBy redesigning existing connectivity architecture to create a single virtualized IoT network, without reliance on the traditional operator network stack, the Onomondo team is bringing a fresh, next-generation approach to the challenges the IoT market continues to face.\u201dIt s a tough market indeed. In January, Sigfox, a French IoT startup that had raised more than $300 million, filed for bankruptcy protection as the pandemic sharply depressed sales. The company blamed the global chip shortage, in part, for squeezing the larger electronic components market and \u2014 by extension \u2014 the demand for IoT device networks.Image Credits: OnomondoBut Karlsen insists that Onomondo remains resilient, onboarding around 50 new customers per quarter. Current customers include Bosch, Carlsberg and Maersk.\u201cBusiness in the first quarter of 2022 was solid and we saw an x4 increase in new customer intake as well as continued triple-digit year-over-year growth within our existing customer base compared to 2021,\u201d Karlsen said. \u201cWith this new funding, we are looking to meet our planned projection of tripling our ARR twice over the next two years \u2026 [It ll] allow us to accelerate our strategy and capture more market share predominantly in Europe.\u201dTo date, Onomondo has raised more than $26 million in capital.",

        "title": "Climentum backs startups with $157M to \u2018accelerate Europe s green transition ",
        "text": "Despite the economic downturn and perilous position many startups find themselves in, some industries are seeing continued momentum in terms of inwards investments \u2014 one of those is climate tech.In 2021 alone, some $40 billion was invested across more than 600 deals, a trend that is seemingly continuing into 2022 with significant capital plowed into startups combatting the climate crisis. In tandem, we ve seen a slew of new funds emerge dedicated to the cause, positioning fledgling climate-focused companies well to flourish against a backdrop of scale-backs and layoffs elsewhere in the startup world.The latest such fund to emerge on the scene is Climentum Capital, which today announced the first close of its inaugural \u20ac150 million ($157 million) fund, which is designed to help curb CO2 emissions and \u201caccelerate Europe s green transition,\u201d the company said.TechCrunch caught up with founding partner Yoann Berno to get the lowdown on what Climentum is striving to achieve, and how it sets itself apart from the incumbents in the space.Sustainable investmentThe driving force behind Climentum s investment philosophy is Europe s new Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), which came into force last year. SFDR is designed to improve transparency in the sustainable investment sphere, so finance companies are more accountable for specific claims they make around their sustainability credentials \u2014 it s partly to do with preventing greenwashing. Climentum, specifically, is focused on being a so-called \u201cArticle 9 fund,\u201d which means that it s making sustainable investments and carbon emission reduction a core investment objective. And in the process, it gives the fund s backers access to all the relevant data they need to report on their own ESG (environmental, social and governance) targets.Climentum s operations are spread across three core Northern European hubs in Denmark (Copenhagen), Sweden (Stockholm) and Germany (Berlin), with backing from a host of Nordic pension funds and Europe-based conglomerates. This includes chemical giant BASF s venture capital arm, which sees Climentum as a conduit to achieving its own climate-focused goals.\u201cWe are backed by BASF which sees in us a strategic investment to get closer to their decarbonization objectives, and a source of intel to guide their corporate strategy in the coming decade,\u201d Berno continued.Berno was also keen to stress that two of Climentum s five founding general partners are female (one of whom has yet to be formally announced), which he sees as a positive differentiator in an industry dominated by men.\u201cWe are 40% female, which is as good as it gets in the industry \u2014 [it s] still not at full parity, but we will continue pushing our gender equality agenda,\u201d Berno explained.Climentum Capital: Morten Halborg, managing partner (Copenhagen); Yoann Berno, investment partners (Berlin); D\u00f6rte Hirschberg, investment partners (Berlin); and Stefan M\u00e5rd, impact partner (Copenhagen). One more partner is to be announced, based out of Stockholm. Image Credits: Climentum CapitalClimentum has currently only secured around half of the targeted \u20ac150 million for its first close, but it expects to close the full fund by the year s end. In the longer term, it s looking to make some 25 investments across Europe, from late-seed stage to Series A, with individual figures ranging from around \u20ac1 million to \u20ac5 million. The six core focus categories that Climentum will target for reducing CO2 will be next-gen renewables; food and agriculture; industry and manufacturing; buildings and architecture; transportation and mobility; and waste and materials.Climentum said that it is already close to finalizing three investments which are currently at the due-diligence stage and are focused on material recycling, alternative protein production and insect farming.So far, so good. But in a field teeming with climate-focused investors and a seemingly insatiable appetite for startups promising to help repair Planet Earth, Climentum is touting tough thresholds in terms of how the team benefits financially from their collective investments. In essence, it has to overcome two stringent hurdles as part of what it s calling a \u201cdual carry\u201d investment model.\u201cThe first hurdle is financial with a competitive return target of three-times over the fund s lifetime,\u201d Berno said. \u201cThe second [hurdle] is a [climate] impact hurdle with an ambitious CO2 emissions reduction target, which will be measured at the portfolio level at the end of the fund.\u201dIn other words, Climentum is measuring success not purely on how much of a return they get for their backers, but how much of an impact their investments have on their climate goals.It s also important not to overlook the strategic locations that Climentum has focused on. The firm is not only going where the policies and attitudes toward green technologies are among the strongest of anywhere else in the world, but also where there is already a significant climate-focused tech startup community.\u201cSweden, Germany and Denmark are in the top five countries in the world in terms of forward environmental regulations and public mandate to accelerate the green transition,\u201d Berno explained. \u201c[And] the three capital cities are some of the most active startup hubs in Europe, with a disproportionate amount of climate tech startups.\u201dA climate of changeIt s also worth looking at the\u00a0timing of Climentum s fund launch, which looks pretty good from myriad standpoints. With growing pressure on the energy markets due to the war in Ukraine, and many countries trying to reduce their reliance on Russian gas, this bodes well for \u201calternative\u201d energy sources, as well as technologies that promise to help nations reduce their energy consumption. On top of that, supply chain issues are causing a shortage of food such as protein, which places emerging startups focused on insect farming, for example, in a strong position.Moreover, the broader economic downturn also puts investors such as Climentum in a good position, including the terms they may now be able to agree with startups.\u00a03 climate tech VCs share how they find, vet and support carbon-slashing startups\u201cThe current economic slowdown has stopped the euphoria on the VC market and caused a significant reduction in startup valuations and amounts deployed,\u201d Berno said. \u201cAs an investor, we are liquidity provider to a market that desperately needs more liquidity to continue financing rapidly evolving innovation.\u201dWhen everything is thrown together into a giant melting pot, it seems clear that now is as good a time as there ever has been for climate tech startups to flourish. There is demand from consumers and corporations alike, while governments are cooking up policies that make society-wide green philosophies much more than a \u201cnice-to-have\u201d \u2014 any business that wants to function in today s world needs to take its climate responsibilities seriously.\u201cThe climate tech companies that have a real solution to some of the world s biggest problems already have pent-up demand from consumers, corporates and governments,\u201d Berno said. \u201cThis phenomenon justifies some of the high valuations which will be amplified by the demand for acquisitions from corporates desperate to meet their 2030 emission targets.\u201d",

        "title": "The end of a second straight month of layoffs in tech",
        "text": "June brought another wave of layoffs in tech, with cuts impacting roughly the same number of employees as May: 16,000 employees, according to tracker layoffs.fyi. Another layoff aggregator from TrueUp paints a more dire picture, counting 26,000 impacted employees this month, up from about 20,000 last month. Either way, the data is grim.The end of a second straight month of nearly daily layoffs shows how every startup sector, from mobility to fintech, is impacted by the downturn. Strategy ranges; some companies are laying off specific teams, others are distributing cuts across all departments, and many aren t responding to comments when asked for further information. There are also the founders who \u2014 within the same breath of their layoff announcement \u2014 will make it clear that they are still hiring for strategic roles.Here are some of the companies that laid off staff this week, and the stated reasons behind those cuts:NianticWhen Niantic released Pok\u00e9mon Go in 2016, the company put itself firmly on the map as an AR and mobile gaming company to watch out for. The animal-collecting game earned $500 million in just its first two months, making it one of the fastest-growing mobile games ever. Over the last six (!) years, the hype around the game may have died down, but its profits have only continued to grow, with Niantic earning over $1 billion from from the title s in-app purchases last year.But beyond Pok\u00e9mon Go, Niantic has struggled to replicate the same level of breakthrough success with the other games it s released, like now-defunct Harry Potter: Wizards Unite or Pikmin Bloom, which also borrows from Nintendo IP.So, like basically every other tech company right now, Niantic had to make a difficult decision. The company canceled four new projects, including a hyped Transformers game, and let go of 8% of its staff, impacting 85 to 90 employees. Just seven months ago, the company raised $300 million at a $9 billion valuation, more than doubling its valuation from 2018.If Niantic can t make another game as profitable as Pok\u00e9mon Go, it could still see success as a company selling AR development tools \u2014 but that would require a pivot. Starting next year, Niantic s Lightship AR development kit will no longer be free, which could open a new revenue stream for the business.Byju s cuts hundreds of jobsEdtech business Byju rose to prominence over the pandemic as it both helped answer the demand for remote education and boasted the highest known valuation of any startup in India. This week Byju s eliminated hundreds of jobs in recent days and pushed back on payments for a $1 billion acquisition that it announced last year, TC s Manish Singh reports.The company, last valued at $22 billion, specifically cut hundreds of jobs at two of its latest acquisitions: Toppr, an online learning startup, and WhiteHat Jr, a kids-focused coding platform. Byju s tells TechCrunch that less than 500 people have been impacted by the workforce reduction.Singh also said that \u201cjobs of about 11,000 employees in India have been eliminated this year due to the market correction (or so has been the single most popular excuse), according to estimates.\u201dTesla lays off nearly 200 Autopilot workers, shutters San Mateo officeTesla laid off the data annotation team working on Autopilot, its advanced driver assistance system, impacting nearly 200 employees. Alongside the workforce reduction, Tesla shut down the San Mateo, California office where Autopilot s team worked.Reports Rebecca Bellan:Until today, Tesla had hundreds of data annotation employees working on the Autopilot team in San Mateo and Buffalo, New York. The San Mateo office had a headcount of 276, and after laying off 195 staffers from all ranks \u2014 supervisors, labelers and data analysts \u2014 the team is left with 81 workers, who sources say will be relocated to another office.Backstage Capital cuts majority of staff after pausing net new investmentsBackstage Capital downsized its staff from 12 to three people, managing partner and founder Arlan Hamilton said during her \u201cYour First Million\u201d podcast that was published last Sunday. The layoff comes nearly three months after Backstage Capital narrowed its investment strategy to only participate in follow-on rounds of existing portfolios. This workforce reduction further underscores that the venture capital firm is struggling to grow, both externally and internally.\u201cIt s not that I feel like there s any sort of failure on the fund side, on the firm s side, on Backstage s side; it s that this could have been avoided if systems were different \u2014 if the system we work within were different,\u201d Hamilton said during the podcast.Hamilton did not respond to requests via email for further comment.StockX s second layoffShoe resale platform StockX, last valued at $3.8 billion, has laid off 8% of employees, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. The Detroit-based company says it has raised over $550 million in known capital since its inception in 2016. StockX send the following statement in regards to the workforce reduction:As a growing global brand, it is important to adapt and pivot to deliver the highest level of service to the millions of customers we serve around the world. The macroeconomic challenges currently impacting our global economy continue to affect consumer behavior, and hit businesses of all shapes and sizes. StockX is not immune to these challenges, and while our business continues to grow, the current climate calls for us to make adjustments. As a result, we made the difficult but prudent decision to reduce our workforce. Parting with team members is never easy, particularly when those team members are people who are passionate about their work and committed to delivering on our brand promise each and every day. However, effectively navigating today s reality requires investment in long-term sustainability. We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted and are working to ensure they are supported in this time of transition.This isn t the first layoff that StockX has announced: In April 2020, StockX laid off 108 people or 12% of its global workforce. Today s cuts are slimmer but show how tensions manifest for the company through two separate economic moments.The StockX EC-1Substack cuts 13 employeesAfter walking back another attempt to raise venture capital, Substack is cutting costs by letting go of 13 employees\u00a0who mostly worked in HR and writer support roles.\u201cOur goal is to make Substack robust even in the toughest economic market conditions, and to set the company up for long-term success without relying on raising money \u2014 or, at least, doing so only on our time and our terms,\u201d Best wrote in a letter to employees, which he made public on Twitter.Substack is still hiring, but at a slower pace. Currently, its jobs site lists three engineering roles, a sales rep, a head of growth and a head of HR. As the company matures, it s also seen great competition: Even Twitter is pushing long-form and newsletter products now. \u201cI m very sorry. Not long ago, I told you all that our plan was to grow the team and not do layoffs,\u201d Best wrote.Is Substack really worth $650M?\u00a0Amount, which was valued at $1B last year, lays off 18% of staffAmount, a fintech that reached unicorn status last year, has laid off 18% of its workforce, reports Mary Ann Azevedo. In a written statement, CEO Adam Hughes confirmed the percent impacted and said that \u201cdue to the current macro-economic environment, we have decided to take some proactive adjustments to ensure Amount s ability to thrive for years to come. We believe these actions are the prudent thing to do for the long-term health of the company and remain extremely excited about the future.\u201dAs Azevedo reports, Amount has raised $243 million to date from investors including WestCap and Goldman Sachs. The startup spun out of Avant, an online lender, in January 2020 to build enterprise software for the banking industry. However, after landing a $99 million Series D last year, this week s cuts show that the businesses growth is not going as planned.",

        "title": "Bo Mobility s e-scooters are built with Formula One engineering",
        "text": "The first wave of electric micromobility was shepherded by the (still largely unprofitable, bless them) shared micromobility companies \u2014 the Limes and Birds of the world that popularized electric scooters. Now, as gas prices surge, the world burns and more people consider traveling to and from work in a way that s cheap, sustainable and fun, sales of electric scooters are seeing an uptick.The global e-scooter market size, which was at around $20.78 billion in 2021, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.8% from 2022 to 2030, according to one study. Given that massive market opportunity, private e-scooter startups are coming out of the woodwork with all sorts of neat little contraptions that fold and whiz and alert riders to impending danger.I know what you re thinking. Surely the market is already saturated, and the big dogs at Okai and Segway have already got it covered. But Oscar Morgan, co-founder and CEO of U.K.-based e-scooter startup Bo Mobility, says the industry has been coming at scooter manufacturing all wrong.\u201cThe way scooters have grown up was they took the micro-scooter, and they strapped a lithium ion powertrain to it,\u201d Morgan told TechCrunch. \u201cThat s almost like if Tesla had said, we want to do an electric car, so we ll strap an electric motor to a Model T Ford.\u201dBo launched in Amsterdam in early June at the Micromobility Europe event, but the startup will sell its first scooters in the U.K. The founders all come from automotive and engineering backgrounds. Morgan and co-founder Harry Wills met at Williams Advanced Engineering, where they both worked on programs to deploy Formula One technology into other products and categories. Luke Robus, Bo s other co-founder, used to work on autonomous cars at Jaguar Land Rover s advanced design studio. Given their expertise, the team thought it would be best to build a scooter like a car \u2014 with a fully integrated chassis.Bo s scooter is designed with a fully integrated, monocurve chassis. Image Credits: Bo MobilityBo s re-engineered chassis uses a \u201cmonocoque\u201d construction technique, which is also referred to in the industry as a structural skin, and it means all of the stresses and loads are supported by the scooter s external skin across a larger cross section than normal tubular or box scooter frames, said Morgan. Bo refers to it as a \u201cmonocurve\u201d because the scooter s aluminum body has a constant curve from top to bottom. Notably, this means it doesn t fold, something Morgan said was a conscious decision to maintain structural and ride integrity. But at 40 pounds, it s light enough to carry easily up some stairs.\u201cChanging this method of manufacture does not make the product cheaper, but it makes it an order of magnitude stronger,\u201d said Morgan, noting the monocurve also enables Bo to seamlessly package a new generation of stabilization and IoT tech into the scooter. \u201cThere s an old saying that if you re strategically strong, the tactics don t matter. And as a fundamental layout, moving from this tubular construction to a true Monocurve, it s strategically the best way to manufacture these products, certainly at the premium level.\u201dAnd premium the Bo scooter is. The startup is currently taking reservations for preorders at around $50 (\u00a340), but the sale price will be about $2,435 (\u00a31,995). Non-committal riders can also get their hands on a scooter subscription for $84 (\u00a369) per month.One of Bo s credences is to build a scooter that prioritizes user experience rather than just a dazzling specs sheet \u2014 although with 31 miles of range, a hook on the neck for securing bags and smart features like GPS tracking and anti-theft, OTA updates and Bluetooth, the specs certainly hold their own.A built-in, retractable hook allows riders to secure bags. Image Credits: Bo MobilityBo was founded in 2019 based on the idea that existing scooter hardware has not only failed to unlock the potential of e-scooters, but also has actively blocked many people from feeling safe and secure enough to jump on one. To address this, Bo has created a system called Safe Steer, an active front-wheel stabilization that can counteract the threat of potholes and bumps in the road, to which scooters, with their small wheels, are vulnerable.\u201cA lot of people claim that they ve created a safe scooter because they put a new set of tires on it or the deck got slightly wider or some sort of mediocre shit like that,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cWhat we wanted to do is create a profound step change. So when we stabilize the steering, suddenly people jump on it and from across all demographics, they feel very comfortable, which is profoundly important.\u201dAnother important differentiator for Bo is the lack of suspension, a feature that Morgan says is totally unnecessary for a scooter that goes tops 22 miles per hour. In fact, Morgan went so far as to say suspension in a scooter is heavy, expensive, unreliable, doesn t work and is the product of companies without a better idea. All you need, he argues, is a long wheelbase, which gives the rider stable and \u201ccruisy\u201d steering, high-quality tires that take up about 80% of normal road noise, and Air Deck.Air Deck is made with engineered elastomer to absorb shock and provide a smooth ride. Image Credits: Bo MobilityAir Deck is basically a bit of engineered elastomer that Bo has attached to the deck of the 6-inch-wide, 22-inch-long deck to put some space between the rider and the scooter s metal.\u201cIt s like the soles of a [sneaker], so in the same way your Nikes take the heat out of pavement, this eliminates the chatter and the vibration that actually makes the scooter exhausting to ride,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cWhen you solve that, it s amazing how much more comfortable the scooter becomes to ride.\u201dWhen can you get one?Bo doesn t want to be one of those companies that promises and can t deliver, so it s doing a soft rollout for a select group of preorders in the U.K.; those people will receive initial units later this year, according to Morgan. The earliest customers, he noted, will provide Bo with direct feedback to help ensure a great product. By early next year, Bo plans to move into mass manufacture and start shipping first to Western Europe in June, and then, in time, to the U.S.To keep things as green and supply-chain-hell-resistant as possible, Bo is trying to make scooters close to the final customer. That means the initial U.K. units will be manufactured and assembled in the U.K., and initial mass manufacture and assembly will be done in Western Europe, said Morgan, who noted Bo aims to find similar locations in the U.S. as it expands.Obviously, preorders will help get Bo to production, but the company will need to raise externally, as well. Bo ended an oversubscribed pre-seed round last year and is in the middle of a seed round that aims to raise $4 million, said Morgan.Startups and investors are turning to micromobility subscriptionsCan Taur be the brand that makes e-scooter ownership cool?",

        "title": "A look into the British DFI s plan to invest in African economies, venture funds and tech startups",
        "text": "On April 4, the U.K. s development finance institution, Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) Group, formally changed its name to British International Investment.As part of the name change, the development finance institution (DFI) announced that it surpassed its pledge to invest \u00a32 billion in Africa over the last two years. It was a reminder of the series of work BII had accomplished on the continent leading to this point: over 600 portfolio businesses with a value of $4.2 billion. Nigeria is its biggest investment market in Africa, with a portfolio of $570 million.Within this period, the impact investor backed several firms in various sectors like banking, trade, private equity and venture capital. Some deals include $300 million direct equity in DP World, $75 million direct debt in Stanbic IBTC Bank, $100 million in Standard Chartered, a $20 million investment in Verod Cap and a $15 million investment in the TLcom TIDE Africa Fund.In a new development, BII said it will invest between \u00a31.5 billion and \u00a32 billion yearly from 2022 and 2026 in \u201cAfrica, parts of Asia and the Caribbean.\u201d But narrowing this to just Africa, the impact investor is looking to mobilize $6 billion into the continent across these five years, Benson Adenuga, the firm s head of office and coverage director for Nigeria, told TechCrunch in an interview.\u201cWe want to do a lot in Africa. Africa is one of the key strategic markets for BII. It has been since inception, as it continues to be even with our current strategy for 2022 to 2026,\u201d Adenuga said. \u201cThe key reason for that is you ve got over a billion people in Africa, the level of developmental needs across Africa is very significant. We see a very significant role that DFIs like us who have the experience, capital and skill sets to support development can bring to the table.\u201dBII has adopted a strategy to make calculated, not sporadic, investments across key sectors: infrastructure, financial services, manufacturing, food and agriculture, health, education, and real estate and construction. The strategy is to divide countries into four categories based on market development and specific risk profiles. They include mature, powerhouse, stable and fragile markets. \u201cWhat we do in each country is a function of where the country stands,\u201d noted the director.In matured markets such as South Africa, Adenuga said BII will have an on-the-ground presence and offer its full suite of services ranging from climate finance, funding for financial inclusion, and equity and debt financing. BII will have offices in powerhouse markets like Nigeria, Egypt and Kenya and offer equity and debt financing to projects in these countries. For stable markets such as Ghana, BII will get representative offices that will provide investments with the option to go all-in if there are noticeable upsides. And in fragile markets, BII will work through intermediaries and partners to make investments across key sectors on its behalf.\u201cWe offer these across the countries and deploy using various instruments, ranging from equity to debt and everything in between. That is how we tend to approach Africa.\u201dProgress so far: Banks, VC firms and startupsAround 57% of the African population have little or no access to financial services and one primary goal of BII s involvement and investments in Africa is to bring more people into the financial stratosphere. In its dealings so far, the impact investor is not only constructing avenues to increase financial inclusion but also increasing opportunities for women because they tend to be more financially excluded than men.In February, FirstBank, one of Nigeria s largest banking groups, received a $100 million credit facility from the impact invest to lend to small and medium businesses in the country. Adenuga said 30% of that money is earmarked specifically to women-owned and led SMEs.BII has also provided investment to TLcom Capital, one of the largest pan-African venture capital firms. This January, TLcom reached the first close of its $150 million second fund; BII contributed $10 million of that money. This investment follows the impact investor s $15 million commitment to TLcom Capital s first fund of $71 million.TLcom Capital is just one of the many firms where BII is a limited partner. It has put money into VC and PE firms like Sawari Ventures, AfricInvest, Novastar Ventures, Verod Capital and Ezdehar Management.Investing in startups through these firms made sense for BII, considering it isn t traditionally structured to take on early-stage risk by partaking directly. However, it becomes hard to ignore some of these businesses as they enter growth-stage phases and need more capital \u2014 most times beyond what venture capital firms can provide \u2014 to scale. BII has upped its game by investing directly in such businesses.\u201cWe have operated as a growth capital company, with at least $10 million of investment and higher. There are several innovative businesses in early stages that we could not support before,\u201d said Adenuga. \u201cBut we see a market gap when it comes to startups with a proven concept, a product on the market that is acceptable and needs more capital; we then come in and co-invest with our fund managers directly in the businesses.\u201dAn example is its investment in B2B e-commerce platform TradeDepot s $110 million (equity and debt) Series B round. In previous rounds, BII had invested indirectly through Novastar Ventures as a limited partner, but in the growth round, BII invested $5 million directly with Novastar on the startup s cap table too.BII and Novastar Ventures also backed TeamApt, a Nigerian fintech, in its $30 million+ Series B last year. The impact investor invested about $5 million. Other African startups that have received money directly from BII include M-KOPA, Paymob, Apollo Agriculture\u00a0and Pylon.Kenya-based agritech Apollo raises $40 million in Softbank-led round, joined by Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, CDCBig plans for climate financeThis week, BII announced its $20 million investment in Moove, a mobility fintech democratizing access to vehicle ownership in Africa. The company provides revenue-based vehicle financing and financial services to Uber drivers. However, unlike the other equity rounds, the Moove deal is a four-year structured credit investment. BII said the funding will enable Moove to purchase and import brand new \u201cfuel-efficient cars\u201d into Lagos, which will be leased to drivers who can earn their way to asset-ownership over three to four years.In an interview with TechCrunch last year, Moove co-CEO Ladi Delano said at least 60% of the vehicles the company finances will be electric or hybrid in the coming years. This grand plan of a company that has raised over $200 million in equity and debt fits well with BII s climate finance objectives. It is one reason the impact investor is interested in the mobility company, according to Adenuga.Moove raises $105M to scale its vehicle financing product across Asia, Europe and MENAHe said over the next five years, at least 30% of BII s total new commitments by value will be in climate finance. It is the first time BII is making clear, explicit targets for climate finance, a development that will make it one of Africa s largest climate investors.Last week, BII, which has offices in numerous African countries, announced plans to invest up to $200 million in hydropower projects across the continent alongside Norfund and Scatec. It follows other climate-focused projects BII has been involved with, such as New Forests and Energy Access Relief Fund \u2014 and smaller commercial ones like Lumos and Greenlight Planet.\u201cWhat we re looking to do is to invest in businesses that lead to a reduction in emission, that support adaptation and resilience, and also help businesses to be able to adapt to the impact of climate finance,\u201d the director said. \u201cWhen we talk about climate finance, people tend to think about just investing in solar panels and renewable energy; it is that and much more. For example, climate-smart agriculture and green buildings are something that we will look at. In mobility, things like electric vehicles, converting from diesel to CNG or clean-energy vehicles \u2014 those are some things that we will support as well. So it s a comprehensive set of investments that we will try to do, which is quite critical for us.\u201dTLcom Capital targets $150M for its second fund to invest in 20 African startupsEgyptian fintech Paymob raises $50M led by PayPal Ventures and Kora Capital",

        "title": "Venture studio Adanian Labs fuels startup growth in Africa",
        "text": "In February 2020, as the world was shutting down, and as businesses downsized on account of the COVID pandemic, John Kamara was busy establishing another new startup, Adanian Labs, in Nairobi, Kenya s capital. It had taken him two years to finally make this dream a reality, and nothing \u2014 not even the pandemic \u2014 was going to derail him.And so, swimming against the tides, he set up the venture studio in partnership with co-founders Irene Kiwia and Bendon Murgor.\u201cPeople thought we were crazy,\u201d Kamara, who doubles up as Adanian Labs  CEO, told TechCrunch.It may have been a tough period to build a business, but they sailed through with their mission.\u201cWe stay the course with startups and make sure they become successful businesses \u2014 we de-risk them from failure,\u201d said Kiwia.New report examines Africa s growth in the digital economy and VC investment landscapeHow Adanian Labs startedThe idea to build Adanian Labs was conceived in 2018, when Kamara was living and working in Cape Town, South Africa, where he witnessed the fast growth of the startup ecosystem, and how, in most countries, accelerators were the default launch pads. He thought the continent was ready for better support, beyond the mentorship and training that most accelerators offered.\u201cThe startup ecosystem was growing but I could not fail to notice the problem of accelerators. You know, startups come out of accelerators and most of them do not have a real opportunity to go to the next level,\u201d said Kamara.\u201cI thought, there has to be a way I can build something that could empower African founders and provide a better support infrastructure to startups\u2026and in a way retrofit it to also build a business.\u201dCompelled to offer more value to startups, the co-founders launched Adanian Labs in Kenya, joining other players, like Nailab, in the space.Adanian Labs targets idea-phase tech startups, offering them all-round support, including capital, advisory and operational backing, building them from the ground up.It makes equity investment of up to $120,000 in these startups.By the end of the one-year venture building program, the startups should have launched a product, onboarded and have repeat customers, have a defined revenue model and have raised or are in the process of closing seed funding.\u201cWe help these startups build their teams, iterate where needed, until we find a market fit product,\u201d said Kamara.\u201cI m not delusional that every startup has to succeed, but from the moment they become part of the Adanian Labs it means that they have the potential to succeed,\u201d he said.A team is captured brainstorming. Adanian Labs plans to help build 300 startups over the next five years. Image Credits: Adanian LabsAfrica-wide GrowthIn a period of two years, Adanian Labs has grown beyond Kenya, by establishing a presence in Tanzania, Zambia, South Africa and Nigeria \u2014 some of the biggest startup and tech hubs in Africa.It is eyeing a pan-African presence by 2025 as it races to help build 300 companies over the next five years. In the interim, the lab is planning on establishing a presence in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Senegal and Ivory Coast, and considering a franchise model to help it fast-track its growth.Having an Africa-wide reach means that startups under Adanian Labs are able to scale in other markets easily as they tap the venture studio s existing infrastructure as a launchpad.\u201cOur presence in multiple countries means that our startups can launch in a second country or even five countries without thinking too hard about it. This means we are focusing on innovations that are applicable across all markets. Not just one,\u201d said Kiwia.\u201cThe speed at which our startups are able to scale to these markets is like 10 times because we have a presence, have local partners and we understand the terrain and the legal aspect of setting up,\u201d said Kiwia.Joy Mwangi, co-founder of Ada animation, a startup in the first cohort, confirmed this to TechCrunch, saying the lab s wide network has also enabled them to tap talent from other major animation markets in the continent like South Africa and Nigeria.While Adanian Labs takes in idea-stage startups, they also help investor-ready startups, with scalable products, fundraise. The venture studio is planning on building a fund that will target startups in the growth stage.\u201cWe have encountered startups that are not young for us to incubate, they are doing very well but would never get the attention of VCs because they lack that visibility that we are bringing to these startups. So, we have a short program to help them raise,\u201d said Kamara.The venture studio is currently incubating its second cohort of 20 startups drawn from the five countries. The group succeeds the first cohort of 12 startups, which included eCoBba, Paylend and AfyaRekod, all three co-founded by Adanian Labs founders.The eCoBba is a platform co-founded by Kiwia to digitize savings groups, tapping their data to extend their range of financial services. Paylend, which was co-founded by Murgor, helps small and medium businesses access credit, while AfyaRekod, co-founded by Kamara, is a patient-driven health tech startup that ensures patient data mobility. All these startups have raised on average $2 million each in seed funding over the last few months.AI and BlockchainBeyond the venture studio, the lab is allied to the Artificial Intelligence Center for Excellence (AICE) and Africa Blockchain Center (ABC), headed by Natasha Ochiel and Jeff Mkungusi respectively, which are independent training and consulting businesses. The AICE has trained 100 data scientists and AI engineers, while the ABC, which is backed by Asia-based blockchain and consultancy business Next Chymia Consulting, has skilled a similar number of blockchain engineers so far.Adanian Labs said such investments ensure that there are enough skilled persons to build the next-generation startups.\u201cWe ve lost engineers to bigger companies. And we feel that we have a bigger responsibility to keep training the techies to keep up with the demand. And so, at Adanian Labs, we are not only building startups, we are building the next generation of African tech experts,\u201d said Murgor, also head of the labs tech team.Kibo School gets $2M to offer online STEM degrees to students in AfricaTech skills gap in Africa has become a thorny issue as multinationals like Visa, Microsoft, Google and East Africa s biggest telco Safaricom snap up the few talents available in the market, forcing entities like Adanian Labs to come up with ways of bridging the gap. Besides, as multinationals look to Africa for tech talent, it has become important to increase the digital and tech skills locally.\u201cMany companies in Africa and beyond outsource the AI and blockchain expertise from India. And we want to change that, and that explains why our capacity building component is so critical, because that s a lot of lost value. Also, for us to build 300 companies, we need the capacity to be local. The world is also shifting towards Africa, and we are preparing young people on the continent to be able to work in the tech space of the future,\u201d said Kiwia.And they seem to be living up to their promises as Adanian partnered with U.S. tech multinational Nvidia last year to collaborate on projects and train 4,000 AI engineers (through AICE) in Africa over the next few years.Adanian Labs also recently partnered with LBank, a cryptocurrency exchange, to build a community of crypto and blockchain developers in Africa. Through ABC they will also run a crypto accelerator to help build next generation startups in the continent.The venture studio, which is raising its Series A funding, also counts itself as one of the first partners of Emurgo Africa, also one of its first investors. Emurgo Africa is an arm of Emurgo, the official commercial division of the Cardano blockchain that is pushing to have \u201cCardano s blockchain adopted as the technological platform standard in Africa for socially impactful solutions.\u201dLooking ahead, Adanian Labs hopes to overcome the current phase, where the global flow of deals is on a slow-down, and rise to power more startups and conquer more markets across the continent.Reiterating this, Kamara said, \u201cWe built and made it work with the little resources we had. We did not stop then, and we do not plan to stop or scale down now. Adanian Labs has turned into an ecosystem, a place where people come to find value.\u201d",

        "title": "Social care SaaS maker Birdie tops up with $30M",
        "text": "Birdie, a U.K.-based caretech software-as-a-service maker, has closed a $30 million Series B funding round led by investment firm Sofina, with Omers Ventures and Index Ventures also participating \u2014 the latter reupping its backing after leading Birdie s Series A last year.Max Parmentier, co-founder and CEO of Birdie, said the latest tranche of funding will go on scaling into continental Europe where it s started to sign partnerships with local care providers, as well as wider business growth. The new funding brings its total raised since being founded back in 2017 to $52 million.In Birdie s home market of the U.K., where it s been operating for around five years, it s now working with some 700 care businesses whose staff are delivering \u201cmillions\u201d of visits per month to the circa 35,000 care recipients (and 8,000 family members) being supported by its customers \u2014 with growth of 3x since the startup last raised.The SaaS platform provides care workers a suite of digital tools to support their work by streamlining admin and patient management while enabling real-time visibility into care events \u2014 helping keep family members informed of important details around their loved one s care.Birdie s wider goal for the business is to use the data its platform is ingesting and structuring to power more personalized \u2014 and even preventative \u2014 healthcare for the social care sector, which remains drastically under-resourced versus the scale of demand for care services.The sector also suffers from a chronic shortage of staff, which is likely driving investor interest in funding platforms like Birdie that promise to drive efficiencies for care customers.August Health digitizes senior living communities for better care\u201cWe want to become a technology partner for home healthcare across continental Europe, where we know the care industry is under increasing pressure,\u201d Parmentier tells TechCrunch. \u201cWe ve already signed new partners in Spain and are in advanced conversations with partners in Ireland. In the near future, we are looking at expanding our footprint to France, Germany and the Nordics.\u201d\u201cOur first priority is to grow our solution so it can support any care provider, delivering any type of care at home \u2014 from complex care to live-in care as we want any older adult to be properly supported,\u201d he adds.\u201cWe are also constantly learning and adapting to better serve our partners and will be looking closely at our existing platform to expand its breadth and capabilities. For example we will be launching a new version of our rostering tool to optimise fulfilment rate, meaning less commuter time and more face-to-face interactions for carers and their care recipients.\u201dAnother focus for the funding will be continuing to build out partnerships, per Parmentier. \u201cWe will continue to develop our open ecosystem to partner with health and care providers. Our aim is to invest heavily in building a clinical engine and enhancing our data analytics capabilities to offer predictive insights.\u201dAsked how Birdie quantifies efficiency gains for its target care provider customers, he points to a recent study which found that 73% of users save on average between 7-15 hours a week on day-to-day operations \u2014 as well as claiming the the platform offers 9x more visibility over day-to-day tasks than other care management software.\u201cIt s critical as fewer hours doing admin work mean more hours to care for the care recipients,\u201d he argues.To quantify the quality of care being delivered by users of its platform, the startup has created what it brands as the \u2018Birdie Quality Score  metric \u2014 which factors in criteria like alert responsiveness, call monitoring and medication monitoring \u2014 and then feeds the data back to care agencies to support them in monitoring and improving the care service they re providing.Parmentier says this data feedback loop is resulting in improvements in its care partners  service quality.\u201cThe aim here is to help them continually improve the quality of their care. As a result, within the first six months as a Birdie user, on average we see a 21% improvement in our partners  quality score, with the biggest improvements within a year; 81% of all concerns are resolved in under 72 hours, and 80% of medication concerns are resolved within a 72 hour period \u2014 up from 58% within the first month. This is a huge improvement and a testament to the ongoing work of the team.\u201dDiscussing progress on Birdie s longer term goal of using the care data-points that are being fed into its platform to power a personalized and predictive value-based healthcare delivery model, Parmentier says it s created its own ontology for tasks and assessments \u2014 \u201cbased on a well-known comprehensive geriatric assessment framework\u201d.\u201cThe best part is, we re already seeing the benefits of this data-driven approach and can validate scientific knowledge through our own data. We re using AI models such as NLP [natural language processing] to further enhance our data analytics capabilities and anticipate health and wellbeing trends for a care recipient,\u201d he goes on.\u201cLooking ahead, we want to continue to improve our health outcomes, while also scaling the platform. We are already able to recommend specific well-being assessments based on care recipient data but we want to grow this focus and look at particular condition-specific interventions, such as mobility and mental health.\u201d\u201cFrom the beginning, our thesis has been that a data-driven solution to home care can help us deliver personalised care to an aging population. We ve built Birdie around this concept, and we re now capable of collecting millions of data points every day that were previously captured on paper, making us the social care platform with the most structured data,\u201d he adds.On the competitive front, Parmentier says there are numerous legacy SaaS providers in the care sector \u2014 some focused on care assessment, others providing tools in people and operations management. But he argues Birdie s modern, platform approach is helping it stand out in a crowd.\u201cOur all-in-one platform uniquely encompasses digital solutions across the entire care business, and we differentiate ourselves by delivering user-centric products accompanied by a high-touch service approach,\u201d he suggests. \u201cAdditionally, by working closely with our partners to provide integrated analytics and insights that highlight performance gaps, we are not only streamlining and digitising many existing processes but we are ultimately improving the quality of care they are providing.\u201dCommenting on Birdie s Series B in a statement, Harold Bo\u00ebl, CEO of Sofina, said: \u201cThe home healthcare tech sector seems ripe for an innovative leader like Birdie to catalyse the necessary social change. Aligned with our strategy to back growing and sustainable businesses, we re excited to join them on their mission to enrich the lives of millions of older adults through preventive and personalised care at home.\u201d\u201cWhat really sets Birdie apart is the combination of an intuitive product experience coupled with a true partnership approach to digital transformation,\u201d added St\u00e9phane Kurgan, venture partner at Index in another supporting statement. \u201cWe continue to be impressed by the team s passion, calibre and commitment to social change and are proud to accompany them on their quest to reinvent care for the better.\u201dElderly caretech platform Birdie gets $11.5M Series A led by IndexLifted raises $6.2M Series A round led by Fuel Ventures for its long-term social care platform",

        "title": "Lightbits Labs lands $42M to speed up server data transfers",
        "text": "Data centers with servers attached to solid-state drives (SSDs) can suffer from an imbalance of storage and compute. Either there s not enough processing power to go around, or physical storage limits get in the way of data transfers, Lightbits Labs CEO Eran Kirzner explains to TechCrunch.\u201cSince its inception, NVMe has been revolutionizing the data storage industry with orders of magnitude higher levels of performance at increasing cost-effectiveness. But the problem is that traditional approaches to data storage are not a good match for NVMe s performance capabilities and cost-effectiveness,\u201d Kirzner said. NVMe is the storage access and transport protocol for flash and SSDs. \u201c[Many data centers] were designed for spinning disks and are based upon a monolithic centralized controller-based architecture which results in lower performance and higher cost and complexity. And traditional software-defined storage systems . . . struggle to deliver even a fraction of the performance and cost-effectiveness that s possible now with flash storage.\u201dKirzner founded Lightbits in 2016 to solve the perennial storage/compute utilization problem. Alongside Sagi Grimberg and Avigdor Willenz, he developed a platform that leverages the NVMe/TCP standard \u2014 short for \u201cnonvolatile memory express/transmission control protocol\u201d \u2014 to lay on top of standard network infrastructure and drive high-performance, low-latency operations between NVMe-oF (nonvolatile memory express over fabric) hosts and controller devices.NVMe-oF is an interface for accessing a computer s nonvolatile storage, or storage that maintains its data when the computer is turned off. Lightbits, together with Meta, Intel, Cisco, Dell EMC, Micron and others, collaborated on the NVMe/TCP standard that was ratified in November 2019 by the NVM Express consortium.\u201cWe recognized that traditional approaches to data storage were not able to keep up with the growing demand and were too expensive and difficult to maintain,\u201d Kirzner said. \u201cThe software-defined cloud architectures popularized by the likes of Amazon Web Services, Amazon, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Microsoft Azure tap industry-standard compute, networking, and storage, and have steadily fueled the growth of an entire new industry. One particularly key area of innovation is the steady adoption of secure, safe, and scalable standard Ethernet TCP/IP networking at increasingly capable speeds. At the same time, newer forms of data storage are coming into the picture, such as NVMe solid state storage.\u201dImage Credits: Lightbits LabsLightbits  software-defined storage platform integrates with existing data center infrastructure. It can scale NVMe data transfer queues to many parallel connections, Kirzner claims, enabling them to achieve access latency of 100 to 120 microseconds or around 200 microseconds on commodity servers. Lightbits previously offered a custom-designed acceleration card to offload memory management and data transfer tasks from servers  CPUs. But the company dropped it in recent months to focus on the software side.\u201cIn an era of mixed applications \u2014 whether virtualized or containerized \u2014 delivering the right level of performance for those multi-cloud applications becomes a critical imperative. The enterprise needs agility, so we delivered a platform that can scale up or scale out, dynamically,\u201d Kirzner said. \u201cAnd it can be deployed on any cloud, whether it s a private cloud or public cloud or an edge cloud.\u201dLightbits has competition in NetApp, Vast Data, Amazon EBS, Pure Storage and Solarflare, the last of which has raised over $300 million in its 20-year history. But in a show of strength, Lightbits today closed a $42 million funding round led by Atreides Management with participation from JPMorgan, Valor Equity Partners, OG Tech and others. While this is a smaller round than the previous, Kirzner points to recent wins, including a certification to work with VMware s vSphere and a partnership with Intel, an investor.\u201cThe unprecedented events of the past two years have significantly impacted supply chains and have organizations thinking differently about their data infrastructure, and rapidly accelerating the adoption of cloud solutions. As a result, the demand for Lightbits accelerated during the pandemic. . . . We ended 2021 doubling our install base, increasing the [customer acquisition] pipeline by 2.3x,\u201d Kirzner said. \u201cThis growth round investment is validation of our strategy and our mission to lead the cloud-native data center transformation by delivering scalable and efficient software-defined storage that is easy to consume.\u201dCustomers include cloud service providers, financial services companies, edge cloud providers, content delivery networks and enterprise IT organizations in the Fortune 1000. While Kirzner declined to reveal concrete financials, he noted that the latest financing brings San Jose\u2013based Lightbits  total raised to date to over $100 million.Lightbits currently employees 100 people, a number that the company plans to grow to more than 150 by the end of next year.",

        "title": "Gloat nabs $90M to build AI-powered internal jobs marketplaces",
        "text": "Gloat, an internal marketplace for corporate talent, today announced that it raised $90 million in a Series D round led by Generation Investment Management, bringing the startup s total raised to $192 million. Generation, notably, is chaired by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. In an email Q&A with TechCrunch, CEO Ben Reuveni said that the proceeds will be put toward expanding Gloat s presence, growing its team of over 250 employees and \u201cstrengthening\u201d its R&D initiatives.The list of employee recruitment, acquisition and jobs boards products is practically endless \u2014 see Workday, LinkedIn and SAP SuccessFactors to start. Reuveni doesn t deny that Gloat faces stiff competition, but he sums up what he believes to be the company s differentiators thusly: \u201cGloat is unique in that we started by powering a solution for internal mobility. Across the market, there are a number of recruiting \u2026 tools to source external candidates, but internal mobility poses unique and nuanced challenges. It requires a real understanding of transferable skills and titles that may not be obvious without the deep, organization- and industry-specific insight Gloat s technology was built to offer.\u201dReuveni founded Gloat in 2015 alongside Amichai Schreiber and Danny Shteinberg. Reuveni was previously a solutions architect at IBM, while Schreiber came from Intel, Mobileye (prior to Intel s acquisition) and HP.\u201cThe traditional approach to work, jobs and careers, which has been at the heart of enterprise operations since the industrial revolution, is now holding businesses and their people back. In an age where the speed of change demands greater agility and adaptability than ever before and employee expectations have risen, enterprises need a more agile operating model for talent and careers \u2014 one that puts every employee at the helm of their own career development and gives businesses the data intelligence they need to make smarter talent decisions,\u201d Reuveni said.Image Credits: GloatAs my colleague Ingrid Lunden reported last year, Gloat sells an AI-powered platform to organizations to power their job boards. Integrated with existing software, Gloat sources information on employees to help match them to job openings at their employer \u2014 whether they re proactively searching or a manager seeks them out. In cases where a worker falls short of requirements, the platform provides guidance on what they need to learn as well as part-time and shadowing opportunities.Gloat uses an AI system to map the relationships between skills, roles, candidates and companies. Trained on CVs, professional profiles, job descriptions, academic content, economic data and compensation data, the system attempts to quantify the ways that job titles, job requirements and skill needs change, Reuveni said. Given the same job title can mean different things depending on the company; Gloat was designed to understand those nuances and automatically infer differences in roles across companies, geographies and industries.\u201cUsing Gloat s AI, every employee gets personalized career path options based on their unique skills and interests. And as job-specific requirements evolve and new roles emerge in an organization, the AI identifies these changes and adjusts its recommendations accordingly,\u201d Reuveni said.Gloat also captures the \u201caspirations\u201d of employees, Reuveni says, informed by the skills they use most frequently and their professional development plans. In the best-case scenario, assuming Gloat s data is accurate, this could provide a resource to management as they decide how to deploy talent.Of course, no algorithm is unbiased. And in hiring, the impact can be severe. LinkedIn years ago discovered that the recommendation algorithms it uses to match job candidates with opportunities were referring more men than women for open roles. The algorithm ranked candidates partly on the basis of how likely they were to apply for a position or respond to a recruiter, and \u2014 as MIT Technology Review notes in its report on the bug \u2014 men are often more aggressive at seeking out new opportunities.A blog post penned by Gloat HR analyst Adam Etzion dated February 2021 discusses an \u201canti-biased dataset\u201d used by Gloat s data science team, customizable to individual customers. And a whitepaper, published last April, details Gloat s bias detection tools that can pick up on unwanted trends in AI-powered recommendations and introduce noise into the data to (in theory) mitigate them.Image Credits: GloatReuveni didn t directly respond to a question about bias in Gloat s algorithms, but he expressed confidence in the system s accuracy. \u201cThe resulting skill trends and recommendations delivered through our platform provide unparalleled workforce intelligence,\u201d he said.Hyperbolic as that might sound, Gloat s customer list is expansive and includes brands like Mastercard, Unilever, Schneider Electric, Nestl\u00e9, Novartis, Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC. More than 1.1 million users in over 120 countries use the platform, Reuveni said, a number that s grown during the pandemic as companies  hiring decelerated and the focus turned toward upskilling their workforce.\u201cAs external hiring looks poised to slow drastically again and businesses are eager to avoid repeating mistakes from the pandemic, Gloat s customers have become beacons for the future of work movement. This has positioned Gloat extremely well to weather economic headwinds and ride the momentum of tailwind,\u201d Reuveni said.How engaged are your employees?Gloat is also benefitting from a general rise in VC funding for HR tech startups. In January, VCs funneled more than $1.4 billion into HR tech, according to PitchBook data, building on a record year \u2014 2021 \u2014 that saw over $12.3 in venture capital invested in HR tech across more than 800 deals.Accel, Eight Roads Ventures, Intel Capital and Lumir Ventures also participated in New York-based Gloat s latest funding round. Reuveni noted that it marks Generation s first investment out of its new $1.7 billion Sustainable Solutions Fund IV, which aims to invest in companies and teams driving \u201cresponsible innovation.\u201d",

        "text": "Fia Jones was 19 years old and studying physics at the University of Auckland in 2019 when she approached Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck at a party and told him she had an idea that would change the game for powering satellites. She d be happy to tell him all about it \u2026 if he d be willing to sign a nondisclosure agreement.Cheeky, badass, naive \u2014 all words that come to mind when imagining this scenario, but it was Jones  tenacity and confidence in the idea she and her co-founders (Max Daniels and William Hunter) came up with that enabled their startup, Astrix Astronautics, to take off.The company, which develops power-efficient solar arrays for satellites, recently secured a spot on Rocket Lab s Electron launch on May 2. Once in Earth s orbit, Astrix s cubesat, a teeny tiny satellite, unfurled into two inflatable solar arrays that measure around 10 square feet and can capture up to 200 watts of power.TechCrunch+ is having an Independence Day sale! Save 50% on an annual subscription here. (More on TechCrunch+ here if you need it!)In other words, Astrix has figured out how to use inflation to deploy a very large surface area from a compact volume, which allows for ease of access to power in isolated spaces.This was the first time Astrix was really able to prove its concept, one that had industry experts skeptical due to the unpredictable nature of inflatable things in space. Astrix is gearing up to close a $5 million seed round, which will hopefully enable the company to scale further toward its midterm goal of providing a low-cost power solution to newer satellite constellation companies that are trying to enter the market today.\u201cPower systems at the moment can cost more than what it costs to build the satellite itself,\u201d Jones told TechCrunch. \u201cBecause we deploy such a large surface area, the biggest benefit for constellations is we re able to switch to silicon cells rather than what everyone s using, which is gallium arsenide cells, that are stupidly expensive. Like $2,000 to $3,000 per watt.\u201d \u201cI didn t happen to meet Peter Beck, and if I missed him at the ceremony, I would have continued to stalk him until I met him. I very intentionally went out to get his attention.\u201dFia JonesWe sat down with Jones to talk about how young founders can break into a legacy industry, the difference between pitching New Zealand and U.S. VCs, and how to deal with the limiting questions investors ask women versus the promotive questions they ask men.The following interview, which has been edited for brevity and clarity, is part of an ongoing series that focuses on founders in the transportation sector.Tell me about the time you approached Peter Beck with your startup idea.At the University of Auckland, he was being awarded for being an adjunct professor. I was on holiday for a long weekend at the time, but one of my friends sent me Beck s location, so I raced all the way there. The ceremony was over when I arrived, it was just a reception, so I snuck in and found him and was like, \u201cI loved your speech.\u201d And he was like, \u201cOh, I didn t make a speech.\u201d So then I was like, \u201cOh, sorry. So I love what you do, and I have this really cool business doing a new and innovative power system, but you have to sign an NDA. I promise it s amazing.\u201d",

        "text": "Vezeeta, a healthtech startup operating in the Middle East and Africa, reportedly laid off about 10% of its staff last week.\u00a0The number of affected employees isn t known; however, multiple sources who posted the news on LinkedIn, including affected employees, revealed that up to 50 people were let go. Vezeeta has almost 500 employees, according to its LinkedIn page.\u00a0TechCrunch reached out to the Egypt- and Dubai-based company for comment but didn t get any response at the time of publication.\u00a0The last time we covered Vezeeta was in 2020, when it raised $40 million in Series D funding (the joint largest single healthtech round in Africa alongside Reliance Health) from Gulf Capital and Saudi Technology Ventures (STV). According to its CEO Amir Barsoum, the healthtech company has received $73 million in total and is generally touted as one of Africa s and the Middle East s soonicorns.\u00a0\u00a0Vezeeta s business has evolved from the \u201cUber for Ambulance\u201d model it launched in 2012 to what it is now: a subscription-based doctor booking and consultation platform. As of 2020, it was operating in 50 cities across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon and claimed its userbase had grown 3x year-over-year to 4 million patients, with 30,000 healthcare providers using its software-as-a-service solution. But currently, the platform caters to 10 million patients across 78 cities (including Nigeria and Kenya, its latest addition) via three outpatient touchpoints: doctor consultations, pharmacy and diagnostics.\u00a0Like many healthtech startups in the region and globally, Vezeeta benefited from pandemic-induced funding, and before this news, there was no indication that the 10-year-old company needed to cut costs. But if there s anything the current venture capital landscape has shown, no sector is immune to layoffs, as startups from real estate, crypto, q-commerce and fintech (among others) laid off nore than 16,000 employees just last month.\u00a0Here s how to protect your equity if you get laid offThere are a few notable examples in the U.S. healthtech space. Earlier this month, Carbon Health, a virtual care provider, laid off 8% of its workforce, citing the need to \u201cadapt to the changing market conditions.\u201d Last week, healthcare unicorn Ro, after recently raising $150 million at a $7 billion valuation, relieved 18% of its staff from their duties to \u201cmanage expenses, increase the efficiency of our organization and better map our resources to our current strategy.\u201d Other platforms globally, as reported by Layoffs.fyi, include the likes of PharmEasy, Sami and Truepill.\u00a0Vezeeta is the first major player in Africa and the Middle East to be affected. The healthtech company didn t release any statements detailing what led to its decision or plans going forward, but affected employees stated reasons Vezeeta probably highlighted in its discussion with staff. One said the layoffs were a result of \u201cdisasters in the market,\u201d while another said it was \u201cdue to the global market crisis caused by the war in Ukraine.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0This layoff news is the second coming from an Egypt-born but Dubai-based company in quick succession. In May, publicly traded mobility startup SWVL announced plans to lay off 32% of its workforce. The company noted changes to its financial realities and the need to implement a portfolio optimization program to \u201cfocus on its highest profitability operations, enhance efficiency and reduce central costs.\u201dLayoffs hit crypto and real estate tech particularly hard this weekThis is not (just) another roundup of tech layoffs10 steps for managing layoffs respectfully",

        "title": "Austin-based True Wealth Ventures raises second fund to back women-led startups",
        "text": "Sara Brand and Kerry Rupp of Austin, Texas-based True Wealth Ventures defy many trends in the venture capital world. The investors, who raised $19.1 million for their first fund in 2018, have just closed on $35 million in new capital for their firm s second fund.In an ecosystem where women make up just 2.4% of partners at venture firms, and considering that the vast majority of first-time funds never actually make it to closing, Brand and Rupp are used to beating the odds. Their investment approach is just as unique in the VC world as their backgrounds: they invest exclusively in seed-stage startups led by women, which they define as having at least one woman with \u201csignifcant decision-making power\u201d on the founding or executive team of the company. Their strategy is a rarity in light of the fact that less than 2% of venture capital funding went to all-female founding teams last year, marking a five-year low. True Wealth s portfolio from Fund I contains companies including cognitive health startup BrainCheck and kelp and seaweed producer Atlantic Sea Farms.\u00a0\u201cWe were the largest fund ever raised with an explicit gender diversity strategy for our Fund I,\u201d Rupp said. \u201cWe were really early to the market, and when we had that kind of organic press back in the day about the fact that we are writing checks to women entrepreneurs, and how rare that was, we just had a firehose of incoming deal flow that lasted for years, frankly.\u201dIn addition to its focus on women-led companies, True Wealth Ventures also only invests in companies they believe are making a positive impact in either health or sustainability, Brand and Rupp told TechCrunch. The firm has a zero loss ratio from Fund I, the pair added, meaning all of the companies it has invested in are still operational \u2014 no small feat for a group of early-stage startups that have had to weather a global pandemic.For their second fund, Brand and Rupp will largely continue with the same strategy from Fund I, sticking to making about 15 investments in total after making 12 out of the first fund, they said.One key difference with this new fund, they continued, is their plan to write larger checks this time around \u2014 up to $1 million per investment compared to the ~$500,000 average investments True Wealth s first fund made.\u00a0\u201cNow, we want to be able to write up to a million dollars [per] first check, because we do usually lead the deals, take a board seat, and take a big role. We have a lot of conviction around our investments and have a relatively concentrated portfolio,\u201d Brand said.Fund II has already invested in three companies since its first close in May last year: trucking and aerospace company Aeromutable, mobility device manufacturer De Oro Devices and health and nutrition platform Flourish, according to Rupp and Brand. Of those companies  six total co-founders, half of whom are women, two are Black, two are LatinX and one is Native American, they added.True Wealth also plans to bring on its first full-time employee outside of Rupp and Brand themselves, an associate who will start next month, according to the partners. Its team already leverages its network of venture fellows and interns to help with sourcing and diligence, they added.While they originally set out exclusively focused on backing women founders, the duo has found a \u201csecondary mission\u201d in educating women limited partners, who make decisions largely on behalf of family offices, and foundations, on how to invest in venture capital. More than 80% of the LPs in both funds are women, Brand explained.\u201cWe actually did a poll of our LPs and found out that of those women, the vast majority had never invested in a venture capital fund before, and the vast majority of those women had never been invited to invest in a venture fund before,\u201d Brand said. \u201cWe realized, in retrospect, that seems obvious with the lack of women in VC funds making investment decisions, and the lack of women entrepreneurs getting VC dollars. This is just a very male-dominated ecosystem.\u201dThe firm hosts educational events in group settings to educate LPs about venture capital s risk profile, capital costs and structure, as well as to introduce those investors to their portfolio founders.\u201cWe think that diversity of the LP base feeds into our priorities and what our investors care about, and the solutions we want to see in the world and therefore what we invest in \u2026 When women come into increased wealth, they reinvest that into their family and community s health, education and welfare at twice the rate of men,\u201d Rupp explained.Correction: As of July 7th, 2022, this story has been updated to reflect that half of the fund s portfolio founders are women, not all six. Why aren t female founders getting a bigger piece of the pie? Theories abound",

        "title": "Deliveree is smoothing Southeast Asia s bumpy logistics landscape",
        "text": "Logistics in much of Southeast Asia is not only complicated, but also expensive. Deliveree wants to solve that problem with a platform that not only lets clients book trucks, but also uses algorithms to determine the best route based on location, trucking loads and even the weather. The company announced today that it has raised a $70 million Series C led by Gobi Partners and SPIL Ventures, with participation from returning investor Inspire Ventures. This brings the company s total raised so far to $109 million since it was founded in 2015.The high cost of logistics means consumers end up paying higher prices, said founder and CEO Tom Kim. \u201cThe way we see the market is that number one, the inefficiency in trucking and cargo shipping has driven up costs materially. Imagine you re in California, Los Angeles, and buying a pair of Nike shoes. What portion of that sales cost is spent on logistics and transportation and warehousing? The answer is very well-documented. It s about 8%. If you buy those same Nike shoes in China, the answer is about 15%. And if you buy the same Nike shoes in Indonesia, Thailand or the Philippines, the answer is going to be much closer to 25%, maybe upwards of 30%.\u201dThe company says that in the past 24 months, it has grown its gross transaction value by 3.2x and will exceed $100 million this year. It currently has 500 employees, and 100,000 drivers on its platform.Deliveree is currently available in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. It focuses primarily on large trucks that move commercial goods or large items. Kim said that based on Google Analytics, it gets more searched than other logistics companies. These include Waresix, Go Box, Kargo Tech and Logisly in Indonesia; Mober, Inteluck and TheLorry in the Philippines; and Giztik, TheLorry and Ezyhaul in Thailand.Kim added that the logistics war is especially heated in Indonesia, where many logistics startups, like Waresix, have received funding.\u201cIt s where a lot of startups and disruptive technology in the space is being built, and it s definitely a very active market,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cThere are all these well-known players, like Waresix or even Kargo Tech. The Philippines and Thailand are also interesting and great markets, but there are less players in the logistics space, especially cargo, trucking and freight.\u201dOne of the problems that Deliveree solves is inefficient use of trucks. For example, trucks deliver a load of goods, but then return empty to the warehouses. If it s part of Deliveree s system, however, companies can book it to ship goods on its way back. That makes better use of the money spent on fuel, time and dispatch teams.\u201cThere are an awful lot of empty trucks driving around in Thailand, the Philippine and Indonesia, because everyone has their own corporate fleets,\u201d said Kim. \u201cThey do one-way delivery and the truck drives back empty. It s even that way for long-distance deliveries, when you re sending goods from one warehouse to some kind of facility in an other city. The same thing happens\u2014you send the truck full one way and it comes back, sometimes hundreds of kilometers, empty.\u201dDeliveree solves these problems with a dynamic marketplace, that Kim says currently has tens of thousands of customers and vendors, including a combination of independent drivers and trucking companies. The marketplace s technology, combined with its volume, can identify customers both ways on a truck s journey so it rarely travels empty. The marketplace aggregates demand and determines optimal routes so trucks remain full. Kim said that before Deliveree came along, a 40% to 50% utilization rate was considered above average. With Deliveree s marketplace, however, trucks can achieve up to a 80% utilization rate, thanks to Deliveree s internally-generated data set, which is has been working on for five years.\u201cEven though it s far from perfect, it gets smarter everyday because we do thousands of bookings every day, and it can make more accurate forecasts about the duration of the booking, the day of the week, the time of the day, even the weather. These are all things that have drastic impact on durations,\u201d Kim said.This also means warehouse has shorter waiting queues, because Deliveree s algorithms can predict what loading and waiting times will be.Most companies have their own fleets, which means hiring dispatch teams, admin teams, security teams, parking lots and security guards. This is still the prominent way it s done, said Kim, and means a lot of overhead for companies. Kim said his argument when pitching Deliveree to companies is that they can de-leverage their balance sheets and book trucks on an asset-light basis like. That means they only pay for trucks when they need them. When the pandemic happened, revenue for many companies went down, and Kim said that led to more adoption of Deliveree as they tried to increase revenue. This increased adoption of Deliveree, as more companies tried to find ways to save money, to convert their fixed costs to variable costs.Deliveree monetizes by charging a fee to the customer and splitting it with the carriers. Deliveree s standard ratio is 80% to the independent trucker or trucking company, and a 20% commission for the company.In a prepared statement, Gobi Partners managing director Kay Mok said, \u201cPost-pandemic, we are moving into an inflationary environment plagued by supply chain issues. Deliveree has built the best tech platform for customers and this will enable them to optimize and lower total cost of operation for the logistics and shipping company.\u201dWe turned our investors into our best source of customer feedback",

As you might ve seen, the Supreme Court issued a major decision on abortion today, effectively overturning Roe v. Wade in declaring that the Constitution doesn t guarantee the right to abortion. While the outcome was expected \u2014 a draft of the decision leaked months ago \u2014 the implications for the tech industry are only starting to become clearer. Stay tuned as my colleagues and I parse the developments.In other news, TechCrunch s Summer Party yesterday was a major success \u2014 thanks to all who turned up! Not to sound like a broken record, but on the events front, don t forget about the upcoming TC Sessions: Robotics in July. And on the distant horizon, TechCrunch Disrupt will return to San Francisco on October 18. I can t wait to see your smiling faces there.Need reading or listening material in the meantime? Consider giving TechCrunch s podcast and newsletter library a look. I ll bet there s a large enough backlog to keep you occupied \u2014 and, more importantly, informed! \u2014 Kyle\u00a0The TechCrunch Top 3Move over, there s a new copilot in town: Proving that GitHub isn t the only platform with the chops to launch an AI-powered pair programmer, Amazon this week debuted CodeWhisperer, a tool that can autocomplete entire functions based on only a comment or a few keystrokes of code. As Frederic writes, Amazon trained the system \u2014 which currently supports Java, JavaScript and Python \u2014 on billions of lines of publicly available open source code and its own codebase, as well as publicly available documentation and code on public forums.Please hold while your company is being acquired: Zendesk has had a rough go of it lately, what with activist investors hounding the customer service software vendor for changes and misguided attempts to boost its valuation. Still, the news of Zendesk s acquisition today came as something of a surprise, if only because of its suddenness. Ron notes that the $10.2 billion transaction \u2014 led by Permira and Hellman & Friedman \u2014 gave investors a way to get some return on their investment, albeit below the $17 billion offer they got in February.Who needs megapixels when you have Benjamins? Leica makes great digital cameras. But for the special edition, limited-run Leica M-A Titan, the German imaging firm decided to go the analog route. The Titanium-clad M-A Titan takes film, and \u2014 if that weren t unobtainable enough \u2014 costs an eye-watering $20,000. Haje reports on the thing, noting that Leica only sells about 100,000 cameras per year. Perhaps it can be forgiven for charging a premium.Startups and VCIn drug-related news, a startup called Wondermed raised $4.6 million to offer at-home, ketamine-assisted treatments to patients. Now, you might ask, Is this safe? Wondermed claims that it is, as do rivals Mindbloom and Fieldtrip Health. But of course they would. Haje is little suspicious of how easy it is to get approved for ketamine treatment but points to clinical studies that prove the drug s efficacy as a therapeutic option for anxiety and depression.Elsewhere in tech:Delivering the goods \u2014 for a price: Offering evidence that the instant delivery market isn t toast just yet, Zomato this week acquired Blinkit, a struggling 10-minute grocery delivery startup, in a $568.1 million deal. Manish reports that investors have questioned Zomato s expansion into the space, given its punishingly high costs and low margins.Hold my battery: Package-transporting drones are cool. What s not cool is having to swap their batteries and payloads once they ve landed. Fortunately, there s a startup for that. Airrow makes a device that operates similarly to a CNC machine or 3D printer, Brian reports, with a gantry that moves along X- and Y-axes to get the battery from the charger to the drone and back again. How nifty is that?The struggle is real: It s never a good look when, fresh from raising capital, a startup cuts a substantial portion of its staff. That s what happened this week with Ro, which laid off 18% of its full-time workforce to \u201cmanage expenses, increase the efficiency of [its] organization, and better map our resources to [its] current strategy.\u201d Natasha notes that former and current employees have previously spoken about the health tech company s inability to gain meaningful revenue from newer products.Looking for a long-term partner: Communication is important in any relationship, but it doesn t always happen right off the bat. That s why Hinge this week introduced \u201cDating Intentions,\u201d a new profile feature that s designed to encourage users to be up front about their expectations. As per Aisha, the curated choices include \u201clife partner,\u201d \u201clong-term,\u201d \u201clong-term, open to short-term,\u201d \u201cshort-term, open to long-term,\u201d \u201cshort-term'\u201d and \u201cfiguring out my dating goals.\u201dWhen life gives you lemons, pivot to crypto: Solana, a startup founded by former engineers and designers from Essential, is shifting focus to embrace cryptocurrency. CEO Anatoly Yakovenko announced this week that its first product, the Osom OV1, will be an Android smartphone that supports decentralized apps reliant on the Solana blockchain. Reactions have been mixed, Jacquelyn reports.Don t eat the lentils: Daily Harvest is blaming the health problems a portion of its customers have been experiencing on lentils \u2014 specifically leeks and lentils. Following a Wall Street Journal article, the company recalled its French Lentil and Leek Crumbles product, which reportedly caused some people to have to undergo surgery to remove their gallbladders and might ve contributed to liver damage and fevers. Daily Harvest is valued at over $1 billion and has been backed by a number of celebrities, Aisha notes, including Bobby Flay, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Serena Williams.Twitter Space: M13 managing partner Karl Alomar discusses fundraising during a downturnImage Credits: Getty Images/dblightOn Monday, June 27 at 11:30 a.m. PT/2:30 p.m. ET, M13 managing partner Karl Alomar is joining senior editor Walter Thompson on a Twitter Space to share tactics and strategies for founders who plan to fundraise during this downturn.Alomar led startups through the dot-com bust of 2000 and the Great Recession of 2008 and will talk about whether investors are still prioritizing growth over profits and how to identify the proof points founding teams must define before their next raise.We ll take questions, so please follow @techcrunch on Twitter and set a reminder for Monday s chat.(TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.

Darrell writes that Cruise s offering will initially operate only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and on designated city streets, but that in the future, those limits might change. It ll depend on how smoothly the service goes.Meanwhile, in India, the central bank is cracking down on fintech startups, reports\u00a0Manish. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has informed dozens of vendors that it s barring the practice of loading \u201cnon-bank prepaid payment instruments\u201d \u2014 prepaid cards, for instance \u2014 using credit lines. Some affected founders are pushing the narrative that incumbent banks lobbied the RBI to reach a decision favorable to them.In other news:Fresh coat of paint: As part of a broader update to Chrome, Google announced a handful of new features coming to the latest build of Chrome on iOS. Among the key additions, the Chrome app is gaining access to Google s Enhanced Safe Browsing feature that proactively warns you about dangerous web pages, Lauren writes. Other updates include user interface changes and the ability to set Google s password manager as the autofill provider.The slow pace of electric: What s not to like about EVs? The wait. As per Jaclyn, surging demand for this year s most hotly anticipated EVs is smashing order books and lengthening waitlists. Rising supply chain costs mean that customers of the Lyriq and other EVs may pay hundreds or thousands of dollars more for a vehicle that arrives months later than expected. Bummer.Streaming still struggling: Ivan reports that Netflix this week laid off 300 people, the firm s second layoff spree in 2 months. Among the headwinds the company is facing are the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the COVID pandemic and password sharing. Netflix lost more than 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter and expects to lose 2 million in Q2.Almost as good as the real thing: Frederic writes that at its re:MARS conference, Amazon announced synthetics in SageMaker Ground Truth, a new feature for creating a virtually unlimited number of images of a given object in different positions and under different lighting conditions. It s intended to help create synthetic data for training AI models in situations where real-world data isn t plentiful.Spyware reaches Android: Security researchers at Outlook recently tied a previously unattributed Android mobile spyware, dubbed Hermit, to Italian software house RCS Lab, Zack reports.

As I m sure it had you on the edge of your seat, I m pleased to report that the team wasn t completely dissatisfied with my inaugural work (it s here in case you missed it), and so they ve agreed to let me have another go. In other uplifting news, it s nearly the end of the week. And if you re staring outside at the same New York City skyline I am, the weather s beautiful. Get that vitamin D in when you re able.Anywho, if you re not NYC bound and happen to be within spitting distance of Menlo Park today, grab a ticket to the TechCrunch Summer Party. I checked, and there s just a few left \u2014 the festivities start at 6 p.m PT. Also, don t forget to mark your calendar for the upcoming TC Sessions: Robotics event, which will feature such guests as Amazon s VP of global robotics and the director of Carnegie Mellon s robotics institute. It won t be one to miss. \u2014 Kyle\u00a0The TechCrunch Top 3Put that in a pipe and smoke it: Connie reported early this morning that Juul, the e-cigarette maker started at Stanford, would be served a \u201cmarketing denial order\u201d from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), preventing the company from selling its products in the U.S. Indeed, the FDA later today ordered Juul to remove all of its products from sale, marking the culmination of the agency s 2-year investigation into whether Juul s products are harmful to children. Juul has the option of pursuing an appeal through the FDA, challenging the decision in court or filing a revised application for its products.Cloud kitchens dissipate: Annie writes that Kune Food, a promising Kenya-based startup renting out kitchens to prepare ready-to-eat affordable meals, will shut down operations and lay off its roughly 90-person workforce. Citing \u201ceconomic downturn and investment markets tightening up,\u201d CEO Robin Reecht said that the company failed to procure the necessary funding and struggled to scale its business model, which relied on selling meals to individual and corporate customers at $3 a head.To sum it up: Remember SumUp? A decade ago, the company made waves by turning basic smartphones into card payment terminals. Now, Ingrid reports, the startup has raised $624 million at an $8.5 billion valuation, reflecting its sustained growth. SumUp claims that more than 4 million small- and medium-sized businesses are using its platform. The new cash will be put toward acquisitions, more hiring and product development.Startups and VCDuring the pandemic, companies with digital products did well. That s no surprise. With folks and workers stuck at home, digital became the only way to collaborate, stay current and find a modicum of escape. One digital subsegment that enjoyed particular growth was e-learning. Recall that Udemy raised tens of millions in 2020. But the tide appears to be turning. MasterClass, the platform that sells subscriptions to celebrity-led classes, cut 20% of its team \u2014 roughly 120 people \u2014 to \u201cget to self-sustainability faster.\u201d As Natasha points out, it s the latest edtech startup to scale back after Eruditus, upskilling startup Section4, Unacademy and Vedantu. Meanwhile, Duolingo and Coursera have seen their stock values slashed.Micromobility ain t looking so hot these days, either, unfortunately. Shortly after Lime exited South Korea and Bird laid off 23% of its staff, e-scooter startup Superpedestrian announced that it will reduce its headcount by 35 employees. Voi followed suit with layoffs at its HQ, letting go of 35 full-time workers. Rebecca notes that the industry s economics have always been tricky, but it surely doesn t help that investors are becoming increasingly wary of startups with high costs and long paths to profitability.In brighter news:Hardwood reboot: Tim writes about a fascinating startup, Vibrant Planet, that s developing what it calls an \u201coperating system for forest restoration.\u201d How on Earth (pun intended) does that work? Well, Vibrant Planet s software, which is aimed at land managers, can prioritize objectives like fire risk using a combination of satellite imagery and AI tools. It can also run analyses to determine how different landscape treatments will affect these objectives, revealing the real-time effects. Pretty neat.Get your steps in \u2014 and your slaloms: A Fitbit-like tracker for skiing? That s different \u2014 and piqued my interest, I must say, as a lover of snow sports. Haje\u2018s piece on Carv details the startup s ski-tracking insert for ski boots, which measures and analyzes technique and beams the data to an app where a virtual coach can give feedback. Carv, which came to venture capital by way of Kickstarter, claims its product can be retrofitted to any boot.Keep Austin weird \u2014 and subterranean: With a tunnel or two under its belt, Elon Musk s The Boring Company plans to build a corridor under Tesla s Gigafactory Texas in Austin. Mum s the word on the purpose, but, as Rebecca hints, perhaps Musk wants a secret road to enter his giant factory. Presumably, he won t have to contend with the traffic issues that plague The Boring Company s Las Vegas project.Lightning in a bottle: Fusion could supply a nearly unlimited amount of power with minimal waste, which is why countless startups \u2014 not to mention governments \u2014 are pursuing it. Zap Energy is among these \u2014 fresh off a successful test of its prototype fusion reactor, the company has raised $160 million in a Series C round. Zap s approach involves sending a plasma stream through a vacuum chamber and then electrifying it, strikingly similar to what happens in a thunderstorm, Tim reports.Drone-compliance-as-a-service: Drone-compliance-as-a-service: Getting the necessary clearance from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones can be a challenge for small businesses \u2014 much less local governments. Airspace Link, which this week raised $23 million in new backing, promises to make it easier by tracking ground-based infrastructure like radar coverage, notable other flights and assets in a given area, Devin writes. Using Airspace s platform, customers can show the FAA they ve built the required safety infrastructure for drone operations \u2014 or so the sales pitch goes.To drive more sales, use shopper-generated content to personalize emailsImage Credits: alphaspirit (opens in a new window) / Getty ImagesConsumer confidence takes a hit during an economic downturn, which is why e-commerce startups should start looking now for new ways to engage customers.Cynthia Price, SVP of marketing at Litmus, shares several ways companies can turn customer purchasing data into content that improves brand experiences \u2014 and makes users more likely to buy.For example, the most-viewed products on your site reflect your most active customers  tastes and interests, which means it s also useful information to showcase in outbound emails.\u201cYou can even break down that data more granularly by layering shopper data,\u201d writes Price. \u201cThis strategy sparks interest, attracts more subscribers to your site and improves the purchase potential of their products.\u201dTo drive more sales, use shopper-generated content to personalize emails(TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.

The music giant this week revamped its in-app discovery feature with a new Live Events feed, which promises to allow users to better discover nearby events and concerts. Events integration isn t new to Spotify. Sarah notes that the company first introduced it back in 2015, but the upgrade signals the platform s confidence that the worst of the pandemic is behind us.Sarah also reports that Spotify is developing a \u201cCommunity\u201d feature that would allow users to see what sort of music their friends are streaming in real time. This could feed into the company s live events effort, too, perhaps by spurring folks to investigate live performances by artists they weren t previously familiar with.Elsewhere, in case you weren t aware, this week was Amazon s re:MARS \u2014 the company s conference touching on various parts of its business. Frederic and Brian were on the ground in Las Vegas to report the latest, fighting both dodgy Wi-Fi and scorching temperatures. (Bless them.) Re:MARS  highlights were perhaps a new Alexa feature that can mimic a voice given a brief recording, an AI-powered coding assistant called CodeWhisperer\u00a0and a fully autonomous warehouse robot. No Robert Downey Jr. cameo this year, sadly.In other news:Write me a letter: Twitter has officially rolled out the long-form content \u201cNotes\u201d feature that Sarah reported on earlier this week. Aisha writes that Notes, which is currently limited to a small group of writers in the U.S., Canada, Ghana and the U.K., has the potential to change how people use Twitter. But will Elon Musk approve?I ain t getting any younger: In search of reliable ways to better engage with younger users, Meta-owned Instagram is testing a new set of features designed to verify ages when people say that they re 18 and older. Through a combination of AI, video selfies, vouching from adult friends and ID cross-referencing, the idea is to keep young people away from material that might affect their mental health and subject them to unseemly accounts.Governing the governors: The Oversight Board, the advisory group reviewing Facebook s and Instagram s content moderation decisions, issued its first annual report this week, Taylor writes. It received over 1 million appeals from Facebook and Instagram users in 2021 and issued decisions and explanations on only 20 cases. But tellingly, the board overturned parent company Meta s initial determination in over two-thirds of cases \u2014 70% \u2014 it reviewed.Spam no more: Tired of junk messages? Good news, if you re an iPhone user. Ivan reports that when iOS 16 rolls out, users will be able to report spam messages with a new \u201cReport Junk\u201d link inside the Messages app. The feature will be available only with select carriers, according to the iOS 16 release notes, but there s no information about which might support it yet.Inclusivity is the best policy: Just in time for Pride Month, Google now lets merchants add an \u201cLGBTQ+ owned\u201d label to their profiles on Maps and Search, Aisha reports. The new label \u2014 available to merchants in the U.S. with a verified business profile on Google \u2014 expands on the \u201cLGBTQ+ friendly\u201d and \u201ctransgender safespace\u201d labels that are visible on business profiles across Search and Maps.",

        "title": "EV fleet management startup Synop steers its way to $10M seed round",
        "text": "When it comes to moving the transportation sector over to EVs, commercial fleets are probably some of the lowest hanging fruit. More often than not, they have consistent routes, reserved off-hour parking and cost a lot less to drive and maintain.But for many commercial operators, EVs are still a wildcard. Gagan Dhillon and Andrew Blejde co-founded Synop to minimize the unknowns and accelerate the adoption of EVs in commercial fleets. In an exclusive with TechCrunch, the company today announced a $10 million seed round led by Obvious Ventures and joined by Wireframe Ventures, Congruent and Better Ventures.\u201cThe electrification of transportation is a massive undertaking, especially with companies operating large fleets,\u201d said Andrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures. \u201cSynop is addressing the biggest, hidden infrastructural barriers for companies looking to make and manage that transition seamlessly.\u201dFleet operators, Dhillon and Blejde found, have a lot of questions that need answering before they ll jump to EVs. \u201cHow do you prolong the life of this vehicle, of this asset? And then how do you operationalize the day-to-day of that asset? Where does it need to be? What time does it need to charge? How long does it need to charge for and on the back end?\u201d Dhillon said. \u201cAll of that is orchestrated through the Synop platform.\u201dOne of the company s first customers is Highland, an electric school bus fleet provider based in Beverly, Massachusetts, that raised a $253 million Series A round in early 2021. The company offers bus fleets through a subscription model that includes charging infrastructure, operating electricity and maintenance. Synop is working with Highland to optimize charging and routing.But it won t be just school buses on Synop s platform. Dhillon and Blejde are designing their software to work with virtually any vehicle type and manufacturer. \u201cWe want to build something that s vehicle class-agnostic, so from Class 2 to 8 on the commercial vehicle side,\u201d Dhillon said. \u201cWe also want to build something that s use case-agnostic. You can bring an electric semi to Synop for drayage use cases \u2014 we re having folks bring electric garbage trucks, which is really surprising.\u201dThe company is also working on a feature to manage vehicle-to-grid, or V2G, connections. EVs have long been viewed as a potential asset for grid managers, one that they might pay handsomely to access. EV batteries plugged into the grid could help stabilize the flow of electricity in instances of equipment failure or downed power lines, giving grid managers time to respond with more durable fixes. They can also help offset peaks in demand. All of this gives fleet operators an opportunity to monetize their assets when they re not in use.But no one who owns an EV \u2014 especially fleet managers \u2014 wants to wake up to find their vehicle s battery depleted at the moment they need it most. \u201cOur software is going to help you as a fleet operator optimize when to push [electricity] back [to the grid] because you don t want to discharge your battery at 4 a.m. and then not have any state of charge for a route that you re supposed to run at 7 a.m.,\u201d Dhillon said.Blejde said that Synop is collecting and analyzing data to help optimize EV usage across different fleets. But it ll also keep a customer s data separate if they request it.Synop can also help fleet managers decide which routes are ripe for electrification. \u201cGive me 100 of your routes, and then let s figure out the road map for electrifying them,\u201d Blejde said. \u201cWe ingest the data, we look at the route, we can give a confidence interval for how electrifiable it is, and then give that answer to customers [to] get their vehicles on board and help them operationalize them.\u201dThe goal, Dhillon said, is to help electrify and manage commercial fleets so that operators can realize all the potential cost savings that electrification can offer.\u201cMost of the competition today is building a very vertical approach where they want to go into it with just their products and not have support for interoperability,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ultimately feel like the big opportunity in this space is for somebody to create sort of this neutral software layer for commercial electric vehicles and chargers.\u201d\u201cWe re trying to position ourselves as you know, for lack of a better term, the plumbing of this industry,\u201d Dhillon said.",

        "title": "It s time to talk about consolidation in the EV charging industry",
        "text": "President Joe Biden s infrastructure bill included a $7.5 billion tranche of cash set aside to build out a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers. Ever since Biden signed the bill into law, EV charging companies have been quickening their pace, eager to take advantage of national momentum and federal funding.Alongside the ambitious attempts at scaling, there has been a wave of consolidation. While some early adopters, like ChargePoint, EVGo, Electrify America and Tesla, have created large national EV charging infrastructure networks, they ve by no means captured the entire market.A recent spate of acquisitions in the electric vehicle charging space is outlining what consolidation in this industry looks like and which players might come out on top.Blink Charging finalized Tuesday its plans to acquire SemaConnect in a $200 million cash and common stock transaction that will add 13,000 EV chargers to Blink s footprint, an additional 3,800 site host locations and more than 150,000 EV driver members, according to Blink. This brings Blink up to 48,000 chargers, according to the company, which means it s finally on equal footing with ChargePoint, the erstwhile leader of EV charging in the U.S. that boasts 30,000 stations with over 47,000 individual charging ports.The infrastructure bill also appears to be attracting foreign companies to increase their footprints in the U.S. EV Connect said Tuesday that it was acquired by Schneider Electric, a French energy management and automation company with a foundation in sustainability and e-mobility. Schneider is using the acquisition to beef out its own charging capabilities and footprint in the United States.Other companies seem keen to grow through M&A. Take ABB, for instance.Earlier this year, ABB s e-mobility business, which makes fast electric chargers for cars, buses and trucks, shared plans to spend $750 million on expanding operations, in large part through acquisitions. In addition to acquisitions this year of India s Numocity and China s Chargedot, ABB has acquired InCharge Energy, a commercial charging infrastructure company, to strengthen its foothold in the North American market.For a company that doesn t have millions in venture funding or a legacy conglomeration backing it, Blink in particular has been coming in hot over the past year. The company, which is publicly traded and was founded in 2009, has long been something of an underdog when compared to the other big EV charging companies. However, it s been using its revenue organically to scoop up companies.Aside from SemaConnect, in 2022 Blink also acquired the U.K. s EB Charging for $23.4 million. Last year, Blink bought Blue Corner for $24 million in cash and stock, and in 2020, the company acquired BlueLA and U-Go for undisclosed amounts.The SemaConnect buy is one to pay attention to, because it specifically allows Blink to take advantage of Biden s infrastructure bill and might signal the direction of future strategic acquisitions by Blink and others. Not only will Blink take on SemaConnect s in-house research and development, hardware design and manufacturing capabilities, but it also gets the company s manufacturing facility in Maryland. Blink s chargers are not currently manufactured in the U.S., so now, the company will officially be compliant with the Buy American mandates, which will allow it to tap into that $7.5 billion.\u201cAlthough we have been actively looking into U.S.-based manufacturing, it would take significant time and resources,\u201d a Blink spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cUtilizing the newly acquired SemaConnect facility greatly reduces those variables and qualifies us much quicker and more cost-effectively.\u201dNotably, even with the SemaConnect acquisition, Blink s network of deployed chargers are mostly Level 2, which takes about six to 12 hours to fully recharge a vehicle. Blink has at most 100 DC Fast chargers, all of which are first generation, according to the company. While it s a start, it s nothing compared to Tesla s. Globally, the luxury EV automaker has over 30,000 charge ports, almost all of them DC Fast. Historically, they ve only been available to Tesla vehicles, but the company is slowly opening up its network to non-Tesla EVs.As the EV industry continues to consolidate, expect acquisitions that involve companies with manufacturing capabilities within the U.S., as well as companies that are finding innovative ways to commercialize and scale DC Fast chargers.",

        "text": "Winnie, the startup that helps families find child care, is now tackling the other side of the equation \u2014 helping caregivers find jobs that pay an equitable wage. Today Winnie announced it is launching a new child care job marketplace that will make it easier for child care providers to hire staff.The company notes that there is currently a major staffing crisis at child care providers, leaving an estimated half a million families without child care. This is partly because caring for children pays very little, with the national average salary at just $11.25. According to The Center for American Progress, half of child care workers are eligible for some form of public assistance and about a third report food insecurity, even though child care is one of the most fundamental services for families.Winnie s job marketplace will show the best local child care jobs, with the \u201cgoal of raising the bar for jobs in the industry.\u201d Users include child care providers, providers at other local centers and parents who want to work at their child s daycare center to spend time with them and get tuition discounts.\u201cWe want child care providers to have mobility and advancement within the industry, rather than leave the field entirely,\u201d said Winnie founder and CEO Sara Mauskopf. \u201cWe also believe that by building a marketplace where early educators can compare positions means that there will now be some competition among employers that will lead to higher wages and better benefits.\u201dWinnie has a new plan to help childcare centers scale careWinnie s other services include Winnie Pro, a subscription service that helps child care centers scale and make more profit.Winnie s child care job marketplace will curate positions from Winnie Pro providers. Mauskopf said Winnie s team also reviews every job that is posted to the platform. Before joining the marketplace, child care providers need to show that they are licensed.The jobs marketplace will monetize the same way the rest of Winnie does, through a subscription for daycare and preschool programs. Any provider can claim a page on Winnie and use some aspects for free, Mauskopf said, but they need to pay a monthly fee to get Winnie s full benefits.How to improve retention, growth marketing s golden metric",

        "title": "Share raises $12M to help companies offer transportation to their employees",
        "text": "Share Mobility, which provides transportation solutions for companies, today announced that it closed a $12 million Series A led by Iron Gate Capital and Renewal Funds with participation from Employment Technology Fund, JobsOhio, Seamless Capital and others. CEO Ryan McManus said that the goal with the new cash will be threefold: supporting growth, people and product.\u201cThe funding allows us to grow into our enterprise customers  more than 2,000 locations across the country and hire the right people to make it happen,\u201d McManus told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cWe are well positioned to expand our footprint in the areas they are asking us to expand, as well as add more features to our platform.\u201dFounded in 2016, Share was initially focused on autonomous vehicles. But it later pivoted to \u201cmobility as a service\u201d; McManus says that the company found a product-market fit during the pandemic.\u201cWhen people started to return to work and companies were in dire need of workers, we quickly realized that if companies are able to hire people that don t own cars, their hiring pool increases from 20% to 60%. And that was the revelation \u2014 to offer a service that helps employers get employees to work, to fill those job openings and retain them,\u201d McManus said. \u201cWe showed enterprise companies that they can solve their workforce shortage by providing transportation as an employee benefit. Companies like Google were already providing it as a perk for employees in major hubs, but as more enterprise companies stake their claim into regions like the Midwest, the need for reliable commuter transportation was clear.\u201dImage Credits: Share MobilityTransportation is a common employee perk among tech giants (excepting those under pressure from activist investors, perhaps). As of 2020, there were an estimated 1,020 private commuter shuttle buses in the Bay Area \u2014 a private transportation system worth more than $250 million. Some Silicon Valley buses travel as far as 55 miles from San Francisco to pick up workers daily.The dramatic expansion of private shuttle programs reflects the pressures that the tech industry has put on major cities. In Silicon Valley in particular, high salaries have driven up housing prices, forcing white- and blue-collar workers to move farther away from their jobs. Absent affordable public transportation or shuttles, employees are forced to pay out of pocket to get to work. This disproportionately impacts low-income workers; according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, low-income Americans spend 37% of their income on commuting \u2014 a percentage that s likely to increase with rising gas prices.Share develops tools designed to help smaller companies build their own shuttle-based transportation solutions, in a nutshell. The platform leverages a company s data to create and schedule routes and works with local fleet operators to provide vehicles and drivers, delivering a toolkit that allows for real-time vehicle tracking. (No word on whether drivers can opt out of tracking if they re concerned about the privacy implications.)All the drivers Share works with are salaried, McManus said, and use different vehicles depending on a company s requirements. Customers get a dispatch team and rider hotline with live agent support.\u201cThe workforce shortage is one of the biggest challenges facing enterprise companies today. HR departments have never before tapped into where their employees live to attract talent and better retain its current workforce,\u201d McManus said. \u201cWe are enabling companies in any part of the country to have better, expanded access to talent through employee data that shows directly where their workers are coming from.\u201dThe mobility-as-a-service market is expected to grow from $182.12 billion to $210.44 billion by 2026, according to Fortune Business Insights. Per\u00a0McKinsey, investors have poured nearly $330 billion into more than 2,000 mobility companies since 2010.But it isn t always smooth sailing. In 2020, Share lost 96% of its revenue nearly overnight as the pandemic put a halt to operations, McManus said. Even amidst the broader slowdown in tech, however, he asserted that Share is in a place to scale through its enterprise model, particularly as companies expand into Midwestern and Southern states. The company has expanded to 11 states with customers planning to add Share-powered routes in over 100 locations this year.Image Credits: Share MobilityOn the horizon is expanded work with municipalities. Share can work with cities to create mobility-as-a-service programs that function like on-demand ride-sharing but with fleet vehicles, McManus explained. Cities can use their own vehicles or Share partners, mixing public and private transit to provide transportation to business parks and other places that municipal busses won t go.Startups like Via are already doing this. But McManus thinks that Share s platform is sufficiently differentiated.\u201cAs enterprise companies continue to battle inflation, worker shortages, supply chain issues and other factors that directly impact its bottom line, it s evident that the need for an economical, scalable solution to workforce challenges are critical. Improved access to transportation and commuter benefits can help close these gaps,\u201d McManus said.Tapping the new cash, Columbus, Ohio-based Share plans to increase the size of its workforce from 35 employees to 75 by the end of the year. To date, the company has raised $19 million in venture capital.",

        "title": "Omio raises $80M as travel demand rebounds after years of COVID-19 crisis",
        "text": "It s been a tough few years for Omio, the Berlin-based travel search and booking platform that saw 98% of its revenues evaporate overnight when COVID-19 hit Europe back in spring 2020. But the company kept on trucking and has found some light at the end of the tunnel: Today it s reporting revenues that have rebounded to more than double pre-pandemic levels. It s also announcing close of an $80 million Series E.The E round includes backing from some new investors, including Lazard Asset Management and Stack Capital Group. Existing investors reupping their support for the almost decade-old business include NEA and Temasek, and funds managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, amongst others.It s Omio s first funding since a $100 million convertible note it took in just under 2 years ago to see it through the first waves of the coronavirus crisis. In all, it s raised around $480 million since being founded back in 2013.The new funding will be put toward reviving global expansion activities that have necessarily had to take a bit of a back seat during the pandemic \u2014 including through M&A and by doing more with its transportation data and inventory by scaling its partnerships (existing collaborations include tie-ups with Kayak, Huawei and LNER [London North Eastern Railway]), among others. Investment for hiring and product dev is also planned.\u201cWhen COVID-19 hit, we paused this global expansion strategy, so that s now back on track,\u201d founder and CEO Naren Shaam tells TechCrunch. \u201cBut with a slightly different twist \u2014 and the twist is basically we re very much focused on our learnings and our scars we gained during COVID-19. So we re going about it in a much more disciplined fashion.\u201dThat means the preference will typically be \u201cbuild vs buy,\u201d he says \u2014 but with the possibility of strategic acquisitions for selective technology and/or inventory to support further global scaling.As it stands, Europe remains Omio s biggest market \u2014 but Shaam says demand in the U.S., where Omio had launched just prior to the pandemic, has \u201cbounced back,\u201d so he sounds bullish again on growth prospects over the pond.The travel startup is not disclosing a valuation for its business at the latest raise but that s essentially a point of principle for Shaam, who bats away the question with a laugh. \u201cWe don t comment on valuation ever,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cLet s just say I m building a business for the long term so I ve never really focused on that.\u201d (Albeit it sounds like it s fair to say the August 2020 raise was a down valuation, and the E round is back up.)Having a long-term mindset amid such a shock crisis for the primary industry your business is built to serve has probably been essential to getting Omio through the worst moments of the past 2 years \u2014 as well as setting it up for whatever problems might lie or lurk ahead. More pandemic-shaped tunnels remain possible, of course, given the COVID-19 virus continues to evolve.One knock-on effect of the crisis has been to force startups in affected industries to tightly focus on managing and shrinking their costs. Omio is no exception \u2014 which is why a slightly more modestly sized raise is all it needs to stay on track now, per Shaam. (We re also told the Series E raise should last it 2 to 3 years.)\u201cCOVID-19 impacted us heavily. We had to focus on costs. And we really kept a very lean business coming out of COVID-19,\u201d he says, describing himself as \u201cvery happy and humble\u201d that business \u201csurvived\u201d \u2014 before immediately qualifying the remark with: \u201cAnd not just survived; but we ve managed to come back so strong that we re doing now two times the revenues of 2019.\u201d\u201cThe travel industry as a whole has not yet bounced back to two times of 2019,\u201d he also emphasizes. \u201cWe re significantly more efficient \u2014 the path to profitability is a lot closer so that just tells us we don t need to continue to raise large amounts of capital and I d rather be independent of that as fast as possible. So it s very much a decision around where the business is today, rather than the need to just keep larger rounds going.\u201dHow close is profitability for Omio? Shaam characterizes the key milestone as now looming on the horizon, saying: \u201cWe very clearly see [it] in the near term.\u201d\u201cOverall it s also a function of how efficient the business is,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe re getting more efficient with scale and as we grow we re getting even more efficient \u2014 which is almost a little counterintuitive because when you grow very fast, you lose some efficiency and you have to catch up.\u201dAsked what s further down the tracks \u2014 and whether Omio is planning for an IPO \u2014 Shaam dubs it \u201ca little premature\u201d for such plans, while signaling that it s where he hopes to end up in the not too distant future. (\u201cThe company is more ready to be \u2014 hopefully \u2014 a public company someday soon,\u201d is how he frames it.)That said, he also points to the current state of public markets, with tech stocks continuing to take a battering, as obviously putting the brakes on moving anything forward on that front at present.\u201cWe ve created the discipline internally from an operational perspective \u2014 our operating leverage has grown tremendously,\u201d he also tells us. \u201cWe re significantly more profitable on a contribution margin basis. Our Opex is low. Both businesses, Omio and Rome2Rio, which we acquired, are outperforming any internal projections we had by significant levels. So, for now, we ll just keep \u2014 as we anyway do \u2014 financial closing on a quarterly basis with IFRS [international financial reporting standards], etc. So we ve got, let s say, many of the tools that are necessary, if not all, of a public company and we ll just keep an eye on the markets.\u201dOmio operates in a space with no shortage of competitors for travelers  attention but its platform stands out by merit of being multimodal, which is to say it can span multiple transport types, from buses and trains to flights and ferries (with price comparison baked in), making it a more comprehensive option for travel planning versus (just) consulting train or flight-booking sites.That said, journeys don t have to be complex, multilegged affairs; Omio can sell you a ticket just to get from destination town A to B (or for an airport transfer), using just the one mode of transport too. But there s no doubt the core platform excels off the road less traveled \u2014 as it s focused on building out its inventory broadly, rather than concentrating effort around major hubs. This means that as the pandemic has shaken out into a longer tail of behavioral impacts \u2014 changing how, where and even when and how people are traveling \u2014 its business looks well placed to adapt to and serve that changing demand.This includes being able to respond to growing concern around climate goals \u2014 and the need to shrink the travel sector s emissions \u2014 given Omio s early focus (when it was called GoEuro) on train travel, which remains a far more sustainable choice than flying, for example, as well as the years of work it put in getting state rail companies on board with its booking platform. (A recent addition is Portugal s state-owned railway company, Comboios de Portugal, with Omio becoming the first third-party booking platform to sell its tickets.)\u201cThere s some fundamental underlying shifts in travel consumer behavior that has played to our advantage,\u201d argues Shaam. \u201cWhen COVID-19 hit, we focused on those as a bet \u2014 and invested in those \u2014 which was more ground transport, more app-driven bookings (vs kiosks) . . . more focused on our core strength, which is non-hub travel; smaller towns, so that became, during COVID-19, \u2018work from anywhere,  go to less crowded places \u2014 and now it s more like where people travel. I won t say \u2018long tail  but definitely not to crowded hubs only.\u201d\u201cAnd all of those destinations need access to ground transport \u2014 and those customers are booking on mobile \u2014 so these kind of underlying shifts are very, very strong and we ve managed to capture a lot of that . . . So hopefully we ve taken a good amount of market share given where revenue is relative to the industry as a whole.\u201dAsked about the hardest moment he s faced as a founder since the pandemic hit, Shaam points back to the revenue-crushing impact of the first wave of COVID-19 hitting Europe in late March/early April 2020 when Omio saw 98% of its revenues dry up. \u201cAnd I wasn t sure how to make head nor tail out of it, whether we were going to survive or not at the time \u2014 so that was a hard moment, followed immediately by furloughs, restructuring . . . so it was just one [hard moment] after another.\u201dBut he also describes a second hard moment that s been sustained over these years, as a result of the uneven impact of COVID-19 \u2014 and that he says he found even harder to navigate, even if, ultimately, the company that s emerged from the pandemic, with all its COVID-19-related scars, is necessarily a stronger, leaner and more mission-committed business.\u201cThere were specific industries that were totally grounded . . . and other industries that were seeing their best days ever. And that was much harder, as a CEO of one of those companies, to navigate through,\u201d he says. \u201cLabor markets are fluid and the [people] who believed in the business have stayed \u2014 and it s very good for me because it shows that they believe in the business and I m very grateful for that.\u201dOmio takes $100M to shuttle through the coronavirus crisis",

        "title": "Samara is building tech to switch Spain s households onto solar energy",
        "text": "Despite being one of the countries in Europe with the most hours of sunshine, Spain has extremely low levels of household solar installations. Madrid-based Samara, a startup founded in May this year \u2014 which is launching a service in its home market today \u2014 wants to change that, spotting what it believes is a major opportunity to accelerate the market s transition to renewable energy.The startup has just closed \u20ac2 million in pre-seed funding to develop technology to simplify the process for households of installing solar energy systems, batteries and EV chargers, as well as developing digital tools for householders to manage their usage. The round is led by European and LatAm VC firm, Seaya and Pelion Green Future, an investment holding focused on clean energy and climate tech.Samara s approach looks similar to Berlin-based Zolar, which offers an online configurator to help householders choose a photovoltaic system to buy or rent and other digital energy products, as well as connecting them with a network of local installers to carry out the work.\u201cWe want to really simplify adoption of solar by customers,\u201d says Samara co-founder, Iv\u00e1n Cabezuela. \u201cThat means simplifying the experience using software and technology to create easier customer proposals, easier projects \u2014 like customers can see where the panels will fit at their home with 3D design, and see what their savings would be, and things like that.\u201dThis will include building an installer management app for the third-party installers Samara intends its platform to work with.Samara s other co-founder, Manel Pujol, points to how much more mature Germany s solar household market is compared to Spain \u2014 but he says they re hopeful their home market can catch up and capitalize on all the plentiful Spanish sunshine.\u201cIn Spain there is a massive gap between the penetration you would expect from a country like Spain and some other countries in Europe,\u201d he tells TechCrunch, citing figures from last year when there were only around 70,000 solar installations completed in the country vs. some 1.5 million in Germany. (For a little more context, Spain has around 6 million households in total.)\u201cIt actually means that 99.6% of the market is still untapped,\u201d adds\u00a0Cabezuela.Samara s co-founders say the reason for Spain lagging on household solar installation boils down to a lack of a supportive legal framework \u2014 with, until 2020, no clear regulation allowing householders to sell excess energy produced by solar panels back to the grid, for example. Additionally, distribution and transportation taxes were actually applied to solar energy generated by households \u2014 creating a disincentive to adopt clean energy by further undermining unit economics.Regulatory barriers essentially meant Spain s domestic solar market was capped until very recently. And that historical underdevelopment means the market has a relative lack of solar installation companies focused on the residential sector \u2014 with only around 1,000 such small businesses at this point.However Samara s co-founders argue that s another key piece of the opportunity they have in front of them now.\u201cThe way the actual process [of delivering residential solar] is done has a lot of room for improvement,\u201d argues Pujol. \u201cFrom how you simulate the production at the home, the software that you use, how you do these estimates, how you present that information to the customer and how you capture them essentially with that information. But it also has to do, longer term, with what is the technology you build to manage this energy ecosystem in the home of the customer?\u201cBecause we re moving from a world where energy was delivered to you through a cable and there was no management at all to a world where you re suddenly going to have production, you re going to have storage, you re going to have a car that you will need to charge. You will most likely electrify your heating \u2014 which is, in many cases two-thirds of the energy consumption of your place. So there s a big electrification component happening at the residential level and there s no clear way to manage that properly. So we want to also \u2014 as we advance \u2014 build the tech to do that.\u201dThat said, if the startup is to scale it will need the residential installer sector to grow with it \u2014 as well as get comfortable adopting the digital tools they re building. Which means that expanding the network and skills of installers is a core piece of Samara s mission.\u201cWe see a huge opportunity of creating high-quality green-energy jobs,\u201d says Cabezuela. \u201cSpain is going to see over 350,000 new green-energy jobs being created by 2030 so we see a great opportunity for hiring, training and developing \u2014 a lot of people are creating that opportunity so when you look at Spain we think it s a market that can actually become the reference player when it comes to solar and [reskilling]. It s already quite advanced in certain aspects.\u201dWider regional moves are also driving the creation of green jobs. The EU s \u2018Green Deal\u2018 investment strategy, for example \u2014 which aims to make the bloc \u2018climate neutral  by 2050 via a plan to attract a trillion euros worth of public and private investment over the next decade to accelerate Europe s green transition \u2014 includes a focus on training and upskilling to future-proof jobs, which means that Member States like Spain are in line for sustained EU support to transform their industries and economies through the development of green jobs.Another barrier is the pure cost for householders of installing solar \u2014 although with more supportive regulation the unit economics have at least improved. Per Samara, the cost of installing (just) a solar system may be in the region of \u20ac7,000 \u2014 but they say typical savings are 50%-70% of the electricity bill.Installing a battery \u2014 which allows storage of energy generated by the householder s solar system (i.e., allowing them to consume more of their own freely generated clean energy, so potentially save more on their energy costs) \u2014 is around \u20ac4,000. While an EV charger can be included as part of the service offered by Samara for about \u20ac1,500.Another characteristic of the Spanish market that could present a barrier to scaling residential solar is the fact that much housing consists of flats in apartment blocks \u2014 where householders may have no direct access to the roof. Here, though, the startup reckons this offers an additional opportunity for the smart digital management software it s building.\u201cThat s the third piece of regulation which has happened in the last two years which has been really encouraging and exciting to us. So basically energy communities and energy storing regulation are now regulated in Spain,\u201d explains Cabezuela. \u201cSpain has quite a modern regulation when it comes to energy communities so it means you can install solar panels in any roof in any building and supply any energy user that is 500 meters away from that installation \u2014 so that means that in community buildings you can do common installations, which is using a common roof and distribute that energy to the neighbours. And even people who live in buildings nearby.\u201d\u201cWe think it s also a really exciting opportunity to bring technology to how people share their energy,\u201d he adds.Samara s co-founders started their careers working in investment banking but also bring plenty of experience scaling and operating high-growth tech companies \u2014 with Cabezuela being ex-Amazon, ex-Uber Eats and also the former country manager of clean energy startup, Bulb in Spain, while Pujol is a former country manager of Uber Eats and was also a general manager for French health insurance startup, Alan.While Uber-branded quick commerce may seem a far cry from helping drive a clean energy transition, Pujol points to one common thread.\u201cThey do have one point in common which is very important for us and was a big part of the [decision to co-found Samara] \u2014 which is how you build a supply in a supply-constrained market? Both Iv\u00e1n and myself during the Uber Eats time and also for myself when I was at Uber we saw what it takes to build supply and use technology to do that and to make it very efficient. And we saw an opportunity here as well to do that.\u201dGermany s Zolar grabs $105M on soaring demand for solar energyEcosia has started ploughing search ads profit into green energy",

        "title": "UiPath s new venture arm backs workflow automation startup AirSlate",
        "text": "Proving that workflow automation is a robust sector, AirSlate, which provides no-code tools for automating business processes, today announced that it raised $51.5 million in a funding round that values the startup at over $1 billion. G Squared led the equity round with participation from UiPath, making AirSlate the first portfolio company for UiPath s newly launched, previously unannounced UiPath Ventures arm.As a part of the UiPath Ventures investment, AirSlate CEO Borya Shakhnovich said that AirSlate will form a \u201cstrategic technology partnership\u201d with UiPath, which will provide resources including technical expertise.\u201cWe see an opportunity to share our experience and passion for fostering the next generation of innovative technology solutions harnessing the power of automation, AI, and machine learning \u2026 We believe there is tremendous potential in deepening and broadening the automation layer of the IT stack to help more companies digitize and automate their operations,\u201d Vijay Khanna, chief corporate development officer at UiPath, said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe missions of UiPath and airSlate to enable companies to grow faster and enhance creativity and productivity for millions of workers are closely aligned, which makes AirSlate a natural fit for our investment from UiPath Ventures.\u201dIt s the belief of some analysts that the market for process automation \u2014 and robotic process automation in particular, which leverages AI to automate certain software tasks \u2014 is headed toward consolidation. A recent Forrester Research report\u00a0predicts that the segment will start to flatten as soon as 2023 as companies shift to broader automation solutions. There s evidence to support this.\u00a0UiPath, which is one of the largest RPA vendors, saw its market cap drop from $35 billion to $15 billion within the span of a year. And a number of smaller players, including Signavio,\u00a0Intellibot\u00a0and\u00a0Servicetrace, were snatched up by incumbent tech firms.But Shakhnovich claims that AirSlate is bucking the trend. While he wouldn t disclose financials, Shakhnovich said that more than 900,000 customers and 100 million users worldwide use AirSlate s workflow solutions for collecting electronic signatures, managing documents and more.\u201cWith AirSlate s suite of products for digital transformation, a user can choose the level of sophistication in their workflow automation journey, from simply going analog to digital to adding some workflow features to the full scope automation,\u201d Shakhnovich told TechCrunch via email. \u201cEnterprise IT decision makers should care about AirSlate because it alleviates the IT talent gap and also solves the problem of the explosion in the number of apps being used, with corresponding challenges in data transport between these apps.\u201dImage Credits: AirSlateAirSlate was founded in 2008 by Vadim Yasinovsky as PDFfiller, with a focus on building editing tools for PDF files. In 2012, Shakhnovich, previously a post-doc fellow at Harvard, joined PDFfiller as it rebranded to AirSlate.Powered by RPA, AirSlate can help perform tasks like negotiating and facilitating payments by generating prefilled pages, sending reminders and notifications and extracting data to update records, Shakhnovich says. The platform leverages rules-based bots that integrate with existing services to automate approvals, data analytics, alerts, permission assignment and data transfer.For companies in need of a fully managed offering, there s AirSlate Business Cloud, which spans PDF editing, esignature workflows and document process automation. Business Cloud subscribers can author new (or edit existing) PDF documents, create and manage workflows, assign roles and send out documents for esigning. They also gain access to an online library of state-specific legal forms, including nondisclosure agreements, real estate forms, wills and customer contracts.\u201cBefore the pandemic, remote work was already increasing in popularity, but the onset of COVID-19 dramatically accelerated the trend,\u201d Shakhnovich said. \u201cThe \u2018bring your own device  workplace policy and remote-first workforce shifts have accelerated the consumerization of enterprise software \u2026 The need for accessibility is pushing the trend of consumerization further, and AirSlate is making business-to-business technology more adaptable, intuitive, and easy to use.\u201dLike its many rivals in the process automation space, AirSlate faces hurdles to further growth, including implementation challenges with customers. According to a 2021 survey from Ensign, while the vast majority of companies see a return on investment from workflow automation, only 20% use the technology as a way to\u202finnovate and create new services. The respondents blame a lack of expertise among their workforce and resistance to change, as well as unrealistic expectations from the C-suite.In another challenge, the broader software-based automation industry \u2014 while still flush with cash \u2014 is headed toward consolidation. SAP acquired German process automation company Signavio in January 2021, just before ServiceNow got into the RPA segment with the buyout of India-based Intellibot.io. IBM acquired process mining software company MyInvenio in April. And Salesforce s MuleSoft and Microsoft followed suit with the purchases of automation tech providers Servicetrace\u00a0and\u00a0Clear Software, respectively.But despite this, and the fact that 80% of its workforce is based out of Kyiv \u2014 a war zone \u2014 Shakhnovich says that AirSlate has \u201cremained resilient\u201d and plans to nearly double its workforce of 1,000 employees and full-time contractors across Ukraine, Poland, the U.S. and other countries where it has bases of operations.\u201cWorking practices across industries continue to evolve and shifting market conditions bring new challenges,\u201d Spencer McLeod, partner and head of research at G Squared, said in a statement. \u201cBusinesses are continuing to seek out innovative, value-driving workplace automation solutions like airSlate. Offering a mix of compatible tools, AirSlate s platform has broad reach and appeals to a large market, and its ambitious management team stays focused on rapidly delivering new solutions at competitive rates.\u201dTo date, AirSlate has raised $185.3 million in financing, a portion of which is debt.",

        "title": "AI-powered parking platform Metropolis bags $167M",
        "text": "Metropolis, a startup building payment infrastructure for parking facilities, today announced that it raised $167 million in a Series B round co-led by 3L Capital and Assembly Ventures with participation from Dragoneer, Eldridge Industries, Silver Lake Waterman, UP Partners and former deputy mayor of New York Dan Doctoroff. CEO Alex Israel told TechCrunch via email that the proceeds will be put toward product development, expanding the company s team and expanding into \u201cnew mobility adjacent verticals.\u201dIsrael contends that parking payment infrastructure is outdated on the whole. Parking garages are stuck in the pre-internet age, he asserts \u2014 disconnected from the digital payments ecosystem (e.g., schemes like Apple Pay and Google Pay). Certainly, there s on-demand systems like SpotHero. Meanwhile, FlashParking, Passport, AirGarage\u00a0and REEF Technology (formerly ParkJockey) have raised hundreds of millions from SoftBank and others for tech-forward parking management. But these don t create the same experiences Metropolis can, Israel claims.\u201cMetropolis is a mobility commerce company, building infrastructure that allows us to transact in the physical world with the seamlessness and ease we experience online,\u201d Israel told TechCrunch via email. \u201cOur platform powers more than 600 parking facilities, we have more than 1.8 million users, and we connect both to thousands of surrounding restaurants, coffee shops and retail stores in more than 60 cities.\u201dIsrael, a serial entrepreneur, sold his last company, ParkMe, to Inrix back in 2015. He said that the experience drove him back to the drawing board to develop a new kind of parking payment and management service.Image Credits: Metropolis\u201cMetropolis was founded in 2017 with the vision of creating the foundation for future modes of transportation which would allow for seamless transactions and movement,\u201d Israel said. \u201cIn order to realize a future with cars that are electric or autonomous, you have to build the infrastructure for them to operate within, and that starts by bringing brick-and-mortar locations online. Parking and movement within urban environments have not changed in the past 70 years and we set out to change that.\u201dTo this end, Metropolis \u2014 which equips existing parking structures with its systems \u2014 enables customers to \u201cdrive in and drive out\u201d without having to swipe a credit card or pay with cash. Using computer vision systems trained on an in-house dataset, the platform can recognize cars via cameras equipped with Metropolis  software, automatically charging the corresponding customers  online account. (To use a Metropolis parking facility, customers have to provide their name, license plate, phone number and payment method.)From an app, customers can review their visit and know the price in real time. Metropolis emails the receipt after they drive out.That s a convenience, to be sure. But Metropolis is investing heavily on the analytics, sales and marketing side of the business, where it sees a larger addressable market. According to Israel, the high-rise and parking structure owners and municipalities that Metropolis does business with can better inform pricing, staffing and maintenance with the insights from the platform. And local businesses can gain visibility \u2014 promotions and discounts from grocery stores, coffee shops and other local merchants that choose to partner with Metropolis appear in the aforementioned app.\u201cOur data means real time, accurate and reliable visibility into usage of, and revenue derived from, built environment assets. For commercial real estate businesses, it s vital to have visibility into both individual property performance, but also portfolio-wide trends,\u201d Israel said. \u201cWe have only scratched the surface of the economic opportunity within our cities. For businesses, Metropolis is able to connect them with new customers and revenue opportunities. For people moving around our cities, Metropolis delivers a checkout-free, just-drive-out experience, facilitating a remarkable journey, while connecting them to the local business around them.\u201dImage Credits: MetropolisGearing up for expansion, Metropolis recently acquired Premier Parking, a Nashville-based company that operated hundreds of parking garages and spaces around the U.S. And last November, Metropolis announced a partnership with Uber, Uber Park, which allows Uber riders to use the Uber app to access locations within the Metropolis network.Israel says that Metropolis plans to expand its workforce of 2,000 employees to 2,500 by the end of the year to support the expansion. It would appear to have the capital to do so; to date, Metropolis has raised $226 million in total.\u201cParking, while historically recession resistant, was not COVID-resistant. So commercial real estate owners and operators turned to Metropolis during the pandemic to find efficiencies and opportunities; as people return to work and travel, we are on a major upswing,\u201d Israel said. \u201cMetropolis built its core business in the middle of a global financial crisis, so while others are hitting the brakes to cut burn, our business is built on solid fundamentals, which is why we attracted so much interest from such a range of investors.\u201d",

        "text": "The e-commerce market in Egypt is expected to grow 30% to $7.5 billion this year, spurred by a growing number of younger shoppers and rising incomes.Local merchants are essential in driving this growth and solving their logistical and operational needs end to end is where new upstarts in Egypt notice the most opportunity. Khazenly, founded in mid-2021, is one such startup. It is announcing that it has raised $2.5 million in seed funding.Khazenly was launched by Mohamed Younes, Osama Aljammali, Mohamed Montasser and Ahmed Dewidar. It is an on-demand digital warehousing and fulfillment management platform that provides an omnichannel solution to help merchants digitize their businesses.On a call with TechCrunch, chief executive Younes said Khazenly solves fulfillment issues for small and medium-sized merchants who focus on business and consumers. He argues that these merchants don t have the resources to pull off renting a large warehouse and engage in manual processes when carrying out operations. Thus, Khazenly allows merchants and social commerce retailers to optimize their fulfillment processes digitally when selling online (B2C), via retail stores (B2B), marketplaces, cross-border or a combination of these channels.\u201cThere is no player in Egypt matching the digital experience that we already have to manage both B2C and B2B,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cThough we solve both aspects separately, we are solving a big pain in the market by automating both.\u201dYounes also touched on the company s focus on convenience. According to him, this, alongside its multifaceted client approach and data/AI-driven product, sets Khazenly apart from similar platforms in the market such as ShipBlu, Flextock and Bosta. \u201cThe combination of all this through the same platform allows us to have a big differentiation,\u201d he said.Image Credits: KhazenlyThe platform s use of AI and big data \u2014 stemming from the CEO s background in that space after spending several years at IBM and Huawei \u2014 allows it to inform merchants on what products to stock concerning location and demand. At the same time, the rest of the executive and management team have experience in other segments of the business, having worked for the likes of DB Schenker, Uber, Amazon and Baker Hughes.Khazenly also offers other services in addition to its warehousing and AI capabilities. They include cross-docking, transportation, delivery and cash collection services.\u201cOur clients carry out all these seamless experiences using our digital platform. Also, beyond the current fulfillment, we do many activities with our clients and support them in marketing and other value-added services,\u201d said Younis.The chief executive said his company operates an asset-light model as it doesn t own any of the warehouses or delivery vehicles. For the latter, Khazenly partners with over 100 last-mile companies to fulfill delivery for its merchants. These merchants are charged varying monthly subscription fees calculated from their space allocated in the warehouse and the projection of orders.\u201cAfter the launch of three weeks, we found that some of the clients cannot calculate how much space their restock will consume in the warehouse,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cSo we developed a calculator in which the client puts in very nice scalar quantities and automatically calculates how much space they will consume in the warehouse, estimates the number of orders and puts out a subscription range.\u201dBosta raises $6.7M to expand e-commerce delivery business across Africa and MENAWhile Younes declined to give exact figures on the number of merchants on its platform or gross merchandise value (GMV) processed, he said Khazenly s GMV is in eight figures. At the same time, the company supports merchants in over 16,000 self-service activities. Some brands that have used Khazenly s digitized fulfillment services come from industries like fashion and electronics to FMCGs such as XRPS by Tradeline and Mozare3.The on-demand digital warehousing and fulfillment platform bootstrapped its way to a soft launch mid-last year and is just receiving its first institutional capital.The round was co-led by regional VCs Arzan Venture Capital and Shorooq Partners. Participating investors include Camel Ventures, Averroes Ventures and a couple of angels.There s been an increased global focus on building more resilient e-commerce supply chains. According to Laith Zraikat, a partner at Arzan, backing Khazenly proves that the \u201clogistics tech and fulfillment sector is still up for disruption.\u201d For Tamer Azer, partner at Shorooq, Khazenly s products and services have the capacity to drive forward the fulfillment industry in Egypt and the wider region.The Egyptian startup plans to continue expanding its portfolio of data-driven products, it said in its statement. One of the products is its mobile dark stores, an offering that allows items to get shipped faster off the back of a more-efficient warehouse forecast.Younis stated that proceeds from the investment would be used to quadruple the company s facilities as it follows a roadmap of building more AI and data-driven products and expanding geographically.\u201cWe are very excited and proud of what we did the last few months. And I believe in the coming days we will do even more strategic and key milestones to let our merchants grow even more,\u201d he said.ShipBlu bags $2.4M for its e-commerce and fulfillment service in Egypt",

        "title": "PayCargo, a fintech for the freight industry, raises $130M",
        "text": "Shipping and cargo services is one of the more fragmented and analogue verticals in the world of industry, with hundreds of thousands of businesses involved in myriad aspects of a process that is fundamentally physical (not digital) by its nature. Today, a company called PayCargo, which built a platform to bring one key aspect of it \u2014 how companies in the business of shipping products and specifically consumer goods pay each other \u2014 into the modern and digital age, is announcing $130 million in funding to expand its platform.The funding, a Series C, is coming from a single investor, Blackstone Growth, and PayCargo \u2014 based out of Coral Gables, FL \u2014 said that it will be used to expand into more geographies, to build out more products around financial and business data, and potentially also for M&A, since the area of providing services to the shipping industry is as fragmented as the shipping industry itself.PayCargo is not disclosing its valuation, but notably, the company is an example of one of the kinds of startups that is not finding it challenging to raise money at the moment: It is profitable, and it has been since it was founded in 2009; it is working in an enterprise vertical that still has a long way to go before it s saturated with competing services filling the same need PayCargo is; and that enterprise vertical itself represents a massive opportunity with the continued growth and globalization of e-commerce overall.\u201cLast year we moved over $10 billion in payments, and we are now on pace for $20 billion in 2022,\u201d said Eduardo Del Riego, PayCargo CEO, in an interview.The company today integrates with around 50 of the larger freight management systems, transportation management systems, ERP and terminal operating systems used by shipping and cargo companies \u2014 and again, that there are 50 \u201clarger\u201d platforms in that wider operational software category shows just how fragmented all of this is \u2014 and the 40,000+ customers using PayCargo (the list includes Kuehne + Nagel, DHL, DB Schenker, BDP, Seko Logistics, UPS, YUSEN Logistics and vendors like Hapag-Lloyd, MSC, Ocean Network Express, Alliance Ground, Swissport and Air France) can currently source and pay more than 5,000 global logistics providers, with that number continuing to grow.For some perspective on that number, when we covered a more modest $35 million Series A investment into the company from Insight partners in 2020, it had integrations with 4,000 providers and worked with 12,000 customers. In between then and now it also raised a $125 million Series B in which it noted that potentially there are up to 40,000 providers to tap for integrations in the years ahead. Indeed, Del Riego noted to me that PayCargo s current size still just represents a tiny fraction \u2014 less than 2% \u2014 of the overall market.The core of the PayCargo platform is a set of cloud-based tools for those ordering shipping services by land, sea or air to send payments, and for vendors to receive them, a set of APIs to integrate the tools into a company s existing FMS and other IT, as well as financing services for those who do not want to pay for the shipments up front.E-commerce saw a huge windfall of activity during COVID-19 \u2014 when consumers who didn t have a lot of places to go and spend money bought significantly more goods online.The growth of the freight market may have slowed down since that peak \u2014 not just because we as a whole are moving back into the physical world; but arguably other factors around the globe like wars and embargoes are changing how things are moving around \u2014 but Del Riego pointed out to me that this hasn t represented a decline to the company in terms of its own revenues, since its cut is made as a flat fee on each transaction, not the size of the transactions themselves.As with others building IT services for the freight and shipping industries \u2014 they include Zencargo, FreightHub, Sennder, Flexport and Cargo.one \u2014 the opportunity is about building more cloud-based services that work smoothly and securely and with other pieces of the operations puzzle; but in many cases, it s still just about providing tools to replace paper and fax machines.And so while that means that a good percentage of PayCargo s customers have not really internalized or indeed yet doubled down on \u201cdigital transformation,\u201d there is an opportunity for the company to become a partner and provider of more data-driven services for its users to fill that gap, too: the company, by the nature of powering transactions between different companies in the ecosystem, becomes a holder of a huge amount of data on how the industry is working: how different products are being shipped, timings and pricing, most active geographies and more. Companies will want to have that information to help shape their own strategies and know how others are performing in the market, but in many cases the kinds of customers PayCargo works with lack the tools to extract, analyze and glean insights from that information themselves.That too is another reason why Blackstone was interested, and why PayCargo has the opportunity for a bigger fintech play here.\u201cI think today the opportunity is to provide the data in a digestible and synthesized manner, to take that and productize it for those customers,\u201d said Vini Letteri, senior MD and head of financial services for Blackstone Growth. \u201cYes in the future, that can also be a handoff of data. But as supply chains get disrupted, there will be more demand for that data, so products to access that will be valuable.\u201d",

        "text": "Overair, a California-based electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle startup, has secured $145 million in funding that will go toward the development of Butterfly, the company s experimental aircraft prototype, by the second half of 2023. As Overair works toward achieving Federal Aviation Administration certification, the startup will use this prototype to validate its designs and mitigate any technological risks, according to Josh Aronoff, head of business development at Overair.\u201cWe ve proven Butterfly s propulsion system, so we ll now begin validating Butterfly s ability to operate safely in real-world weather conditions, carry significant payloads and fly incredibly quietly,\u201d said Ben Tigner, co-founder and CEO of Overair, in a statement.Because Overair is a spinoff from Karem Aircraft, Butterfly s propulsion system benefits from decades of military VTOL programs led by the legacy company, according to Overair. The company claims to have the broadest flight envelope and smallest sound footprint of any aircraft in the burgeoning industry, due in part to its propulsion system that uses four large propellers that spin slowly when hovering and even slower when cruising. Quiet aircraft that doesn t noise pollute dense urban environments is essential for commercializing eVTOL.\u201cOur technology was meant to drop Navy SEALs into hot zones, and we re going to use it for urban air mobility (UAM) so that you and I can go to a Rams game from Orange County,\u201d Aronoff told TechCrunch.It s the patents and core technologies behind Butterfly that attracted Hanwha Systems and Hanwha Aerospace \u2014 the defense and information technology unit and aircraft engine producer of South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group, respectively \u2014 as investors in Overair. Hanwha, which holds a 30% stake in Overair according to the startup, previously invested $25 million into Overair s Series A in 2019. This latest round brings its total investment in Overair up to $170 million.As part of Hanwha s investment, the company will provide Overair with electric motors and battery packs for the startup s eVTOL prototypes, according to the startup.Hanwha Systems recently joined up with Korea Airports Corporation and SK Telecom, a South Korean telecommunications giant that s working to bring air taxis to market in the country by 2025, to introduce an operating model for commercializing urban air mobility in a metropolitan area. Overair wouldn t confirm if it s directly involved in this partnership, but said it would be participating in South Korea s UAM Grand Challenge to commercialize air taxis.With the fresh capital, Overair will also begin building out its commercialization team and go-to-market strategy, according to Aronoff. While Overair s relationship with Hanwha will open up the South Korean market for the startup, Aronoff said Overair is targeting a U.S. launch first.\u201cI would expect it to be cities that might be different from those that you ve heard others announce,\u201d said Aronoff. \u201cSo you ve heard LA, Dallas and Miami. The Northeast Corridor is the most economically productive stretch of the world. So for us, where the weather is not like it is in LA \u2013 75 degrees and sunny every day \u2013 to have a vehicle that s able to fly people in the most economically productive cities, which are relatively close together, that works really well for our use case.\u201dUnlikely players team up to lead South Korea s air taxi industry",

        "title": "Launch Africa, the VC firm that has backed over 100 startups, closes first fund at $36.3M",
        "text": "Pan-African venture capital fund Launch Africa Ventures today is announcing the close of its $36.3 million fund, which it has primarily used to invest in B2B and B2B2C startups across Africa.In an interview with TechCrunch, managing partner Zachariah George said Launch Africa has backed 108 startups across 21 African countries. They include the likes of Nigerian neobank Kuda, Kenyan B2B e-commerce retail platform MarketForce and Tunisian edtech startup GOMYCODE.Although these startups have progressed to growth stages, the Mauritius-based firm invested in them earlier in their journey. It typically backs seed and pre-Series A startups and cuts an average check size between $250,000 to $300,000. Some startups in these stages include Sudanese fintech Bloom, Bostwana-based insurtech Alpha Direct and South African big data platform Carscan.George says the firm, considered the most active early-stage VC on the continent, will continue to expand its geographic footprint and back startups in other countries. \u201cI can t think of a single fund that covers as many markets as we do,\u201d the managing partner said. \u201cWe re doing deals in the DRC, Madagascar, Sudan, Botswana, Benin, Togo. People use the word pan-African loosely, but when we say pan-African, we truly mean what we do.\u201dGeorge launched the firm s Fund 1 alongside Janade Du Plessis at the height of the pandemic in July 2020. The fund achieved its first close in September 2020 and a final close by March 2022.Both partners had huge finance and investment experience before starting Launch Africa. An angel investor, George worked as a Wall Street bulge-bracket investment banker before co-founding two well-known accelerator programs in Africa: Barclays Rise Growth Accelerator and Startupbootcamp Afritech. On the other hand, Du Plessis held the chief investment officer position at the African Development Bank and founded Abrazo Capital, a social impact-driven investment firm.Launch Africa, with over 238 retail and institutional investors from 40 countries per its statement, has invested over $24 million in its portfolio companies. Most of these investments are one-time checks, as the early-stage VC seldom takes on subsequent rounds.\u201cIn fund one, we have limited capacity for follow-ons. If we were to reserve a significant portion of our fund for follow-ons like many other funds do, we wouldn t be able to cover the whole continent and multiple regions and products,\u201d said George. \u201cAny of our portfolio companies that need significant capital at the next round of funding, we provide an opportunity for our LPs to back them.\u201dLaunch Africa says it helps LPs with due diligence and waives fees when they invest alongside the fund s lead checks. These LPs have deployed over $14 million in Launch Africa portfolio companies.\u201cThe Launch Africa team works with founders and expert advisors to fast-track exit opportunities for investors.\u201d said Du Plessis in a statement. \u201cProviding our exit strategy during these challenging times instills investor confidence and brings significant benefits to the African tech ecosystem.\u201dSome of Launch Africa s LPs include German fintech-focused CommerzVentures. The firm s managing partner Patrick Meisberger said his firm was \u201cpleased to partner with Launch Africa Ventures to invest in some of the most exciting fintech investment opportunities in Africa.\u201d Fintech contributes heavily to Launch Africa s portfolio; over 38% of its companies are from that segment. The rest include e-commerce and marketplaces (16%), health tech (13%), logistics and mobility (12%), data analytics/AI (11%) and edtech (7%).Venture capital firms like Launch Africa sometimes come under heavy fire for backing too many companies within a short period. Yet, George views the company s strategy as necessary given the stage Launch Africa plays and the broader Africa s early venture capital market.\u201cThere s very little strategic non-financial value among pre-Series A investment on the continent. Most of the money that comes at the early stages are from angels, friends and family and accelerators, and very regional VC firms. There s nothing wrong with that. I mean, it s the backbone of any mature industry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it s very important to have a plan to scale into multiple geographies and product verticals, and you can t do that by playing low.\u201dGeorge asserts that the ability to invest significant capital at the early stage and founder-friendly terms with a lot of non-financial value-adds accelerates a company s growth from what would typically take three to four years to as little as 12 to 18 months. \u201cThat s the benefit of positioning ourselves as specialists in early-stage investing,\u201d George said.Launch Africa doesn t intend to slow its pace despite the gloomy VC landscape; the firm might double down on some of its portfolio companies at better discounts. Like a few local investors that have spoken with TechCrunch recently, Launch Africa said it would provide follow-on capital \u2014 via bridge and extension rounds \u2014 especially to those going through cash crunches.\u201cWe are working hand in hand with each portfolio company in capital preservation and revenue generation for their unique business challenges,\u201d said Margaret O Connor, the company s board chairperson to TechCrunch. \u201cWe are trying to help the founders understand how to navigate challenging macroeconomics and focus on how to make more money more quickly so that they continue to grow.\u201d O Connor has experience as an entrepreneur, MasterCard executive and government adviser in the U.S., the U.K., Asia and Europe in her investment management portfolio.That said, Launch Africa isn t solely interested in holding the moniker of Africa s most active early-stage fund. It also wants to build a reputation for taking diversity and inclusion into account. The firm claims these themes are \u201ccentral to its investment ethos,\u201d as shown by two metrics: 91% of founders in its portfolio are African, while 20% are women.",

        "title": "Echodyne s compact, steerable radar spots $135M investment and prepares to diversify",
        "text": "When Echodyne showed off its compact but intelligent metamaterial radar system back in 2017, the applications seemed endless\u2026 but some, like urban air mobility and autonomous vehicles, we re still waiting on. Fortunately the defense industry has buoyed the company up during a couple tough years and it is now looking to pursue new opportunities, powered by a $135 million funding round co-led by Bill Gates.The company s technology, detailed back then, essentially replaces large, power-hungry, often mechanized radar arrays with a device the size of a hardback book.The power and weight savings alone would make it attractive enough, but it also adds capabilities like intelligent beam-forming for directing the radar s ability to resolve details to a small area of interest. It s made possible by metamaterials, a class of tech lorded over by Intellectual Ventures, and where Echodyne was incubated.Originally the thought was that this would be a great addition to things like drones, which are quite limited in the sensing hardware they can carry comfortably without affecting range or maneuverability, and autonomous vehicles, on which space is likewise at a premium.EchoDrive was the company s first commercial product, put out in January of 2020 and intended for AVs \u2014 and as you may recall, that market is still struggling to emerge. Not to mention the pandemic thing.Fortunately the capabilities of Echodyne s tech were not lost on certain deep-pocketed others, like the Army, Department of Homeland Security, NASA and Northrop Grumman, all of which have signed contracts with the company for various reasons.Image Credits: Echodyne\u201cYou don t need to solve the corner cases of AV when the topic is radar solutions for uncrewed aircraft systems, national and critical infrastructure security, or defense mission requirements. And we have products for dozens of applications in each one of those large and global markets,\u201d said Eben Frankenberg, Echodyne s CEO and co-founder.The reality was people were hungry for better and smarter ground radar as part of a new generation of tracking and sensing that needs to occur in industrial and military situations around the world. If your main radar for detecting small UAVs at a military depot is the spinning one on top of the control tower, you re low-hanging fruit for a modern savvy drone operator. But a dozen Echodyne radars scattered around the place might do the job 10 times better for a quarter the price (these numbers are purely for illustrative purposes).Can t hurt that they now offer the devices in desert tan:Image Credits: EchodyneIt s all part of a stationary, defense-focused package Echodyne calls EchoGuard. You can see in the top render that it s meant to act as a full-sky tracking and warning system.\u201cWe re really leaning into the idea of networks of radars deployed that operate cooperatively, as a single instance, and feed intelligent radar data into higher-level systems,\u201d Frankenberg said. No surprise there; the use case springs naturally to mind for institutional customers replacing or augmenting existing large-scale systems and legacy installations.That s a good use case for existing airports and bases, but it could also apply to future infrastructure, like what might be needed in and around cities to support the still theoretical air taxis and drone delivery services perpetually a couple years out.And don t think they ve given up on self-driving cars, either:\u201cAll of the very clever developments in AI require the solution stack to run at light speed without aberration, with the goal of achieving the highest probabilistic confidence,\u201d Frankenberg said. In other words, decision making (is it safe to change lanes?) relies on the system s confidence in the inferences it makes, and more and better data improve that confidence. \u201cOur radar design needs to allow for higher levels of the solution stack to direct radar operation, to confirm or clarify elements of the operating environment and drive higher probabilistic confidence for improved decision and actuation.\u201dOf course automation goes beyond consumer-level mobility into industry and robotics, but we ll learn more about Echodyne s applications there when the time is ripe.The $135 million C round (the company has raised $195 million total since 2017) will allow the company to grow beyond the relatively safe markets of defense and federal contracts it has happily subsisted on during the pandemic. \u201cOur product team needs to grow and mature and we have global sales and marketing expansion to plan for and get right. All of this takes time and money,\u201d Frankenberg said.The round was co-led by Bill Gates and Baillie Gifford, with participation from Northrop Grumman (converting customers to investors is an occasion to celebrate), NEA, Madrona Ventures, Vulcan Capital and Vanedge Capital.",

The IFC said in the disclosures that it s eyeing a stake not exceeding 20%.The agency said it will commit a further \u20ac15 million ($15.9 million) for future co-investment opportunities together with the fund. The PAF II will invest in \u201cseed to Series D rounds, and follow-on rounds in top portfolio companies,\u201d according to records by the IFC. The investment is awaiting approval.\u201cIFC s proposed investment in Partech Africa Fund is an equity investment of up to \u20ac25 million, not to exceed 20% of the total Fund commitment. In addition, IFC has proposed a separate co-investment envelope of up to \u20ac15 million on a delegated authority basis, to facilitate IFC s ability to participate in potential future co-investment opportunities alongside the Fund,\u201d the IFC said in the disclosure.Reports say African startups raised record-smashing $4.3B to $5B in 2021It is not immediately clear how much Partech was looking to raise, as the VC firm, one of the largest in Africa, declined to share specific details of the fundraising with TechCrunch.However, it is expected to be larger than the Fund I, which closed at $143 million in 2019 and had the participation of the IFC and some other major institutions like the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Dutch Development Bank (FMO) and the African Development Bank Group \u2014 entities that are driving investment across the continent. The EIB and FMO plan to invest in this round too, with the latter considering injecting up to \u20ac25 million too.The PAF II will be invested in early and growth tech startups across the continent, availing the much needed funding in the continent. Last year startups in Africa raised between $4.3 billion and $5 billion, and while this was great growth (almost double) from the previous year, it was still marginal when compared to other regions across the world. Such funds as the PAF are geared at closing this gap.\u201cIFC anticipates the project to increase access to equity alongside operational value add for startups across Africa. Access to venture capital in Africa remains low compared to most other emerging markets. The project is also expected to increase innovation in key markets across Africa through the support of market-disrupting digital business models,\u201d the IFC said.\u201cIn markets where investees grow rapidly and become sizable market players, innovation at scale can generate large impacts on a market by pushing traditional players to innovate and introduce digital solutions or reduce traditional incumbents  market share,\u201d the agency said.Partech has 15 investments in nine countries across Africa, including Wave, a U.S. and Senegal-based mobile money service provider; Tugende, a Ugandan mobility-tech company; and Trade Depot, a Nigeria and U.S.-based company that connects consumer goods brands to retailers.Partech is doubling the size of its African venture fund to $143 millionParis-based VC firm Partech unveils Chapter54 accelerator to help European startups cross into AfricaFintechs in Africa continue to overshadow all other startups in funding gained",

        "title": "NexStride gadget that helps people with Parkinson s fight \u2018freezing  attracts $2.8M",
        "text": "One of the challenges faced by people with Parkinson s disease is the possibility of \u201cfreezing\u201d during normal movement, causing falls and lack of mobility. Surprisingly, small external cues can help them escape freezes or avoid them altogether \u2014 and De Oro has raised $2.8 million to commercialize its NexStride portable gadget, which provides those cues on demand.The simplest way to understand freezing is that the normal pathway in the brain for your body turning the impulse \u201cwalk forward\u201d into actual movement doesn t activate correctly. This can lead to slow or stopped movement despite willing one s limbs to move the way they normally do.Studies have found a surprisingly effective technique for preventing this: cueing. When a person sees or hears an external cue associated with moving forwards, it activates a different pathway for walking forward, breaking the person out of the frozen state.De Oro s device provides two such cues. One is a little metronome-like ding that makes the brain think about moving in time with it rather than going step by step. The second is a laser-projected line just ahead of the user s feet that seems to activate the idea of stepping over or past something rather than just \u201cforward.\u201dThe NexStride attaches to a walker or cane using a little stretchy loop like a bike headlight, with a corded controller that can be put somewhere convenient for the user. Hardware dials on the main unit let them control the volume and tempo of the metronome, and the position of the laser line.There s plenty of studies about the efficacy of this approach in the lab, and the company has polled its customers, finding a large majority were able to get around more confidently and with less fear. Clinicians they ve worked with recommend the device to clients as well as a convenient catch-all way to improve mobility.Walter and Richard both found the device very useful in getting around on their own terms. Image Credits: De OroThere are a few items like this out there, like the U-Step laser and sound equipped walker. But the U-Step is built into the walker itself: a large and heavy item not particularly suited for use outside the home, and certainly not something a person with mobility issues could throw in the trunk. As is often the case with accessibility hardware, there s a lot of legacy stuff from decades past.The advantage of the NexStride is it s self-contained and portable \u2014 people often have a favored cane or walker and the gadget can be attached to pretty much anything and switched in a few minutes. \u201cNexStride doesn t make people compromise on choosing between their favorite mobility aid and having access to these effective visual and auditory cues,\u201d said De Oro founder and CEO Sidney Collin.Manual operation was a design choice prompted by feedback; users and clinicians recommended it over the automatic approach NexStride first attempted, which would presumably have turned on the laser or sound when the person stopped moving. Turns out people like to be in control \u2014 especially people for whom control is an everyday medical issue.The only sticking point is the retail price: A somewhat eye-popping $500, not yet covered by insurance. While it s not the most expensive medical or mobility device out there, it s a little hard to reconcile the sticker price with the device itself, which, although well designed, doesn t seem particularly exotic or expensive to build.The company said that it priced the NexStride to be competitive with the other options out there, which it handily outperforms, while also keeping manufacturing in the U.S., which necessarily adds to the costs somewhat.While full retail sounds like a lot, any veteran can get a NexStride for free from the VA, which is definitely a vote of confidence from an institution that serves a lot of people who need it. And the Parkinson s Wellness Fund may cover from half to the full cost through grants.With an aging population that s healthy and mobile, devices like this may be escaping the likes of medical suppliers and becoming more of an ordinary consumer gadget. After all, Parkinson s can affect people before even middle age, and you know that demographic will be doing a lot of comparison shopping.The $2.8 million seed round, which will go toward scaling up De Oro s operations and getting the device to more people, was led by True Wealth Ventures, with participation from AARP, StartUp Health, Capital Factory, Wai Mohala Ventures, Kachuwa Impact Fund, Barton Investments, HealthTech Capital, Wealthing VC Club, Rockies VC and Mentors Fund. The company raised $1.5 million before this.The funding and innovation here are a reminder that there are many frontiers on which to found a startup and lots of less visible people and groups who stand to benefit from even ordinary-seeming advances in tech.",

        "title": "New report examines Africa s growth in the digital economy and VC investment landscape",
        "text": "A new report from\u00a0Endeavor Nigeria\u00a0reveals that Africa s digital economy and tech ecosystem is set to experience exponential growth periods. The report is dubbed \u201cThe Inflection Point: Africa s Digital Economy is Poised to Take Off.\u201dIt highlights important events in the continent s tech ecosystem until this point, compares its journey with other emerging markets and provides guidance into the opportunities within various sectors. The report, which included analysis from McKinsey & Company, says its assertions are backed by an acceleration in strong market fundamentals and the impact of the pandemic.The market size of Africa s digital economy is massive and, if projections go as planned, should top $712 billion by 2050. The dynamics that play into this forecast, aside from the impact of COVID, include a youthful population (the youngest globally), rising smartphone adoption and internet penetration that has led to a burgeoning tech ecosystem backed by local and international VC dollars.While many publications and reports have done an excellent job of describing the opportunities that abound on the continent, a few stakeholders like Endeavor believe a more precise picture needs to be painted.New York-based Endeavor is a global community of \u201chigh-impact\u201d founders across almost 40 underserved markets in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The firm also has a fund, Endeavor Catalyst, which has backed many unicorns outside the U.S. and China.\u201cFrom my conversation with many entrepreneurs, we kept hearing the same thing: While we talk about the African story and opportunity, not everyone has the African context,\u201d Tosin Faniro-Dada, the managing director and CEO of Endeavor Nigeria, said to TechCrunch on a call.\u201cEntrepreneurs will say to me, \u2018when we have to go beyond our local markets and walk into rooms to meet investors in San Francisco, New York and London, most of them don t even know what we re talking about; they don t understand the African opportunity. \u201dThe organization s report intends to shed more light on Africa s market dynamics. For investors, it hopes to help them build local market intelligence. And though they are inclined to follow the money, Endeavor wants them to look beyond usual market opportunities and map out exit pathways.Here are a few interesting points from the newly-launched report.Africa s digital opportunityThe continent s $115 billion digital economy is in its early phases. For instance, 33% of individuals use the internet compared to a global average of 63%. The report also pinpoints other metrics such as fixed and mobile broadband connections and mobile cellular network coverage.Much of the growth so far has been concentrated in four key markets: Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Egypt. These markets make up 32% of Africa s population, 51% of the continent s mobile network connections, 50% of its professional developers and 51% of its GDP.Image Credits: ITU World Telecommunication/IOT indicators database/EndeavorAfrica s GDP has tripled since 1990; it recorded a 4% CAGR compared to Europe s and Latin America s 1.7% from 2010 to 2019. The report also stated that Africa is also recording faster growth in consumer spending than most other regions: 9.4% CAGR from 2018 to 2023 compared to Eastern Europe s 6.9%, Asia Pacific s 6.8%, Western Europe s 4%, North America s 3.5% and Latin America s 2.8%.\u201cBy 2030, Africa is expected to have a total of $2.5 trillion in consumer expenditure from over 1.7 billion consumers,\u201d the report said.On talent, Endeavor s report says two of the top five fastest-growing markets for GitHub contributions are in Africa: Nigeria and Egypt. According to the report, African developers created 40% more open source repositories on the software engineering marketplace in 2019 than in 2018 \u2014 recording a higher growth percentage than any other continent globally.Other statistics include job projections from various channels: 44 million jobs if internet penetration reaches 75%, 3 million jobs from online marketplaces by 2025 and 1.7 million jobs due to Google s $1 billion investment in the continent.The continent s investment storyThe report first highlights the growth of venture capital on the continent over the past six years; within this period, investments in African startups have grown 18x. From 2020 to 2021, it grew 2x faster than global startup funding, it said.Endeavor also underscores the widely believed theory that Africa lags other emerging markets such as Latin America and Southeast Asia by five years. According to the firm, the continent s funding trajectory from 2015 to 2020 is akin to Southeast Asia and Latin America s 2010 to 2015 periods. \u201cGoing forward, Africa s trajectory looks in line with SEA and faster than Latin America,\u201d it said.Image Credits: Crunchbase/EndeavorBut as more global investors pay attention to Africa s technology scene and local investors step up their game, what s becoming evident is a shortage of capital in the early-growth stages, particularly around Series A investments. According to the report, there is an 84% drop in Series A rounds vs. seed rounds in Africa. This is compared to 37%, 70% and 66% in the U.S., Southeast Asia and Europe. There s an opportunity here for local funds to invest above seed rounds, for larger Africa-focused firms to double down on Series A and for global funds to go lower than Series B, C and D.The report also highlights how it s taking less time for the continent to mint unicorns, the increase in mega rounds, liquidity events and exits (examples exist of local and international acquisitions, traditional IPOs and SPACs).Sectoral transformationThere are five main sectors in Africa s startup landscape: financial services, commerce, transport, healthcare and education. Endeavor s report describes why these sectors are vital to Africa s growth, the various pain points startups try to address and how they go about it by providing a \u201cwedge\u201d \u2014 like an entrance to the market \u2014 and building around this wedge to offer more services that address other consumer and business needs. Some examples highlighted in the report include M-Pesa in fintech, Yoco in commerce, Kobo360 in transport, Helium Health in healthcare and uLesson in education.Image Credits: Bill Gates Foundation Gallup report (2014)/EndeavorAt the end of the report, Endeavor takes an individualistic perspective and deep dive into Africa s largest markets, emphasizing what makes each country stand out. It calls Nigeria Africa s largest internet economy and South Africa the continent s most inclusive internet country. It describes Egypt as having one of the most diverse landscapes of digital businesses and lauds Kenya s internet economy for contributing the most to Africa s GDP.\u201cThe data gathered in this report is clear \u2014 Africa is the next digital growth frontier,\u201d said Faniro-Dada. \u201cThe combination of our young and digitally savvy population, an emerging technology ecosystem and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on behaviors is set to trigger an inflection point in our digitization journey. We have been excited by the increased levels of funding that our entrepreneurs are attracting, but we want to make it even easier for more investors to bring out their cheque books to catalyze the growth that we believe is pending.\u201d",

        "title": "Crypto startup Ledger teams up with Cathay Innovation to launch $110M sector fund",
        "text": "Cathay Innovation is hoping to secure the bag in a new investment partnership with a company that secures crypto assets.The $1.5 billion venture capital firm is entering the crypto market with a new $110 million fund dedicated to the sector that it will operate jointly with Ledger, a French startup focused on digital asset security, Cathay co-founder Dennis Barrier told TechCrunch.The fund is similar to a corporate venture firm in that it s partially operated by a company, but Ledger is different from the typical corporate VC because it s a Series C-stage startup, not a large conglomerate looking to make bets on nascent firms. Ledger Cathay Capital, as the new fund is called, will invest in seed to Series A companies across a broad variety of segments across the crypto landscape, including emerging DeFi, security and infrastructure, according to Barrier.Denis Barrier, co-founder of Cathay Innovation Image Credits: Cathay InnovationLedger s claim to fame is its USB-like device that confirms crypto transactions, allowing users to keep physical control of their private wallet keys rather than relying on their memories for access. The startup s most recent fundraise brought in $427 million for the company, its CEO Pascal Gauthier told TechCrunch \u2014 a slight increase from the $380 million in commitments that TechCrunch reported at the time because of new commitments that came in thereafter. Cathay Innovation was the lead investor in that round, which valued Ledger at $1.5 billion, Gauthier said.Cathay, a backer of Ledger for the past five years, asked Ledger to team up with them to raise new capital for a crypto fund rather than doing so alone because the venture firm wanted to \u201cget the best of both worlds,\u201d Barrier explained. He wanted the fund to be able to move quickly like a traditional VC while providing long-term support and expertise for portfolio companies akin to a corporate venture arm, Barrier explained. It s taken about a year for the fund to come together as an official vehicle after the two companies began conversations about this strategy, he added.While it s somewhat unconventional for a startup to launch a venture arm, it s a lot more common in crypto \u2014 Uniswap, FTX and Binance are three prominent examples. Ledger itself, which Gauthier said has been profitable for years, has made some recent investments into other startups. One of them was RTFKT, the NFT company Nike acquired last December, Gauthier said, though he did not share the names of any of Ledger s other bets in the space.\u201cWe invested from the balance sheet because the pressure from our partners was too high, so we had to start somewhere. Now, we are putting some structure around what we were doing, very naturally and very quickly \u2026 but we ve been in the market for some time,\u201d Gauthier said.Cathay, a global venture firm that s best known for its bets on tech startups including Pinduoduo and Chime through generalist funds, has paired up with companies in this manner in the past to go deep into a sector. It runs a smart energy fund in conjunction with Total Energy and Hubei as well as a mobility fund alongside Valeo, both of which operate with models similar to Ledger Cathay Capital, according to the Barrier.Although Ledger itself is best-known for its hardware, the fund has a broad mandate, according to Gauthier.\u201cAnyone that can build on top of the [Ledger] platform \u2014 which is basically anyone in the market \u2014 has a shot of engaging with us [through the fund],\u201d Gauthier said.The fund hasn t yet deployed any of the capital, he added, noting that it closed very recently.\u00a0Bpifrance, the country s public investment bank, is one of the new fund s investors, according to Ledger Cathay Capital s official announcement.With the recent crypto market downturn, I asked Gauthier if he was concerned about the timing of launching this fund and whether it s too late to capitalize on opportunities in crypto. He responded by noting that Ledger was founded in 2014 and has weathered downturns before, adding that he is still optimistic about the market s potential, in part because of the developer activity he s seen on the Ledger platform.Gauthier thinks this will be a key differentiator for Ledger Cathay Capital, as Ledger has a global view of new dApps and blockchains coming to market from its own users \u2014 the company claims it secures 20% of the world s cryptocurrencies. That s part of why Gauthier said he isn t concerned about crypto prices right now, in addition to the advantages he said stem from being a global investor headquartered outside of the United States.\u201cWhen markets are getting tough, that s when we are at our best,\u201d Gauthier said.Subscribe to TechCrunch s crypto newsletter \u201cChain Reaction\u201d for news, funding updates and hot takes on the wild world of web3 \u2014 and take a listen to our companion podcast!",

        "title": "Nimbus launches a tiny EV prototype that s like a motorbike with a roof",
        "text": "As shared e-scooter companies have infiltrated cities and e-bike sales have soared, micromobility has been offered up as a panacea to save us all from the ill humors and packed streets caused by gas-guzzling cars. However, one of the major roadblocks in front of well-intentioned city dwellers who d love to trade in their cumbersome and environmentally unfriendly vehicles for an e-bike or scooter remains: What happens when it rains?Nimbus, a Michigan-based electric vehicle startup, wants to solve that problem with a simple solution: Put a roof on it.The company recently came out of stealth with a prototype for its Nimbus One, a tiny, three-wheeled EV that \u201ccombines the convenience and cost of a motorbike with the safety and comfort of a car.\u201dThe Nimbus One. Image Credits: NimbusThe thin, pod-like vehicle is only about 2.75 feet wide and 7.5 feet long, which Nimbus says makes it three to five times smaller than a compact car \u2014 the better to park and navigate busy urban streets. It also has room behind the driver s seat for another passenger or storage for things like grocery runs. Lihang Nong, Nimbus s founder, said the Nimbus s backseat will have ISOFIX points for baby seats.The vehicle also tilts, like a motorbike or scooter would, due to Nimbus s proprietary tilting technology.\u201cScooters are fun, but they re also kind of dangerous, but they lean, so that s fun,\u201d Nong told TechCrunch, noting the front airbag in the Nimbus. \u201cOur vehicle does the same thing, but it takes the skill out of it. So my mom can get in and start to drive. Have you ever driven a boat? It drives kind of like a boat. You turn left and it pitches to the left.\u201dThe Nimbus One is classified as an auto-cycle in the U.S., which means it s \u201cthe best of both worlds,\u201d according to Nong.\u201cWe don t have to pass these stringent, very expensive and lengthy processes for getting our vehicles certified,\u201d Nong said. \u201cBut also, drivers don t need a motorcycle license to drive, so anybody with a car license can use our vehicle. They don t have to wear a helmet.\u201dSince the Nimbus is made for city driving, not highway driving, it has a top speed of 50 miles per hour. Its 9 kWh battery has a range of 93 miles and a charge time of 1.2 hours on a Level 2 charger or 5.4 hours on household power, according to the company. Taking a page out of Gogoro s book, Nimbus s batteries are removable, swappable and can be charged in the owner s own home.The Nimbus One s minimalist interior includes a display screen, Bluetooth-connected speakers, power windows, rapid phone charger, heating and optional air conditioning. Image Credits: NimbusThe Nimbus One s minimalist interior includes a display screen, Bluetooth-connected speakers, power windows, a rapid phone charger, heating and optional air conditioning. The vehicle also has a front-collision warning and additional features can be sent to the vehicle with over-the-air updates, according to the company.Pre-orders for the Nimbus One started over the weekend, and test drives will be offered to enterprise customers within a month, said Nong, who noted the company is taking $100 down payment per order. The vehicles themselves will cost around $9,980 to buy outright, but the company also intends to offer them as a subscription service for $200 per month.Nimbus expects first deliveries from impending pre-orders to come in the third quarter of 2023, but the company hasn t yet chosen its launch city. Nong said Nimbus will roll out city by city, in part so the company can set up proper after-sales service to maintain vehicles in each city as it grows.Nong says that while he expects most of Nimbus  business to come from direct to consumer sales, the startup is also in talks with several shared micromobility operators, other vehicle sharing programs and food and grocery delivery companies. All vehicle functions, like door locks, power windows, speakers and even steering, braking and vehicle speed can be controlled via Nimbus s central control unit and accessed via API, making the vehicles highly compatible for a vehicle-sharing program. In addition, up to four 2.2 kWh swappable battery packs can be equipped with the vehicle, a feature that has the potential to cut overhead costs associated with charging shared fleet vehicles.Of course, manufacturing costs for any vehicle have never been higher than they are today, so Nimbus will need to raise another round to make it to production. The startup wants to raise $20 million in equity and $10 million in debt for its Series A, as well as bring on a customer who is also a strategic investor.Nimbus closed a $4.7 million seed round last August and expects investors from that round \u2014 Thiel Capital, the JAM fund, Conscience, Ponooc and Gaingels \u2014 to follow on into the next round.\u201cAs cost of living in cities becomes untenable for young people and as they increasingly adopt sustainable energy, Nimbus will provide them with the perfect blend of both: an affordable, lightweight, convenient electric vehicle that serves their basic needs,\u201d Jesse Michels, an investor at Thiel Capital, told TechCrunch. \u201cFrom a market perspective, it s the only EV company with 35% margins that should improve with scale. It has the safety profile of a car with the fun and agility of a motorcycle. Longterm, Nimbus should revolutionize urban mobility and do what Tesla is doing up-market, for younger people and urbanites.\u201dThis article has been updated with a quote from Thiel Capital. Correction: A previous version of this article stated the company was based in California, and that it plans to produce vehicles in Q3 2022.",

        "title": "Onfleet nabs $23M to further develop its last-mile delivery software",
        "text": "The importance of last-mile delivery (the movement of goods from a shipping hub to their final destination) came into sharp focus during the pandemic. Statista projects that e-commerce will drive the global last-mile delivery market to double to more than $200 billion by 2027. But as last-mile deliveries of essentials continue to increase, so, too, do customers  expectations. According to an Anyline survey, more than three-quarters (76%) of shoppers said that an \u201cunacceptable\u201d delivery experience \u2014 e.g., a very late one \u2014 would affect their decision to order from a company again.It comes as no surprise that the market for last-mile delivery technologies is an active one, then. Companies like Zippedi and Carmagos are using robots and mini distribution centers to streamline inventory for last-mile delivery, while others, such as Berlin s GetHenry, are supplying e-bike fleets to delivery business customers like Gorillas and JustEatTakeaway.com.A growing segment of the last-mile market is squarely focused on logistics, including Onfleet, which claims its software facilitates millions of deliveries per week for thousands of businesses (including Sweetgreen). Offering evidence that the demand for last-mile solutions might overcome broader economic headwinds, at least in the short term, Onfleet today announced that it raised $23 million in Series B funding led by Kayne Partners with participation from Savant Growth.Co-founder and CEO Khaled Naim said that the new capital will be put toward product development, expanding Onfleet s product and engineering capabilities, and enhancing the company s enterprise offering. It brings Onfleet s total raised to just over $40 million to date.Tracking deliveries with Onfleet. Image Credits: Onfleet\u201cThe pandemic dramatically accelerated growth in the market (and Onfleet s growth) and created a need for these types of services that did not exist previously,\u201d Naim told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cThere was a time when fear and uncertainty surrounded grocery store visits, so delivery was simply a safer option for consumers, especially for demographics like the elderly or those with pre-existing conditions. Delivery, driven by consumer demand and the pandemic, is increasingly becoming the key channel for businesses especially in grocery, cannabis, prepared meals and restaurant, alcohol, pharmacy and retail categories.\u201dNaim co-launched Onfleet in 2015 with Mikel Carmenes Cavia, a high school peer of Naim s, and David Vetrano, who Naim met while pursuing his MBA at Stanford. Growing up in the Middle East, the three were inspired to develop a \u201cuniversal way to share a location,\u201d which became Addy, a platform that allowed anyone to create a URL representing latitude and longitude coordinates.After trying to commercialize Addy with delivery businesses, Naim said he realized that many of these businesses weren t using logistics technology. Instead, their dispatchers were memorizing every tree and fork in the road and using that experience to manage driver fleets. It s then when he, Cavia, and Vetrano decided to expand their vision to develop a delivery management platform: Onfleet.\u201cAs delivery drivers started to use smartphones to communicate with dispatchers we thought: \u2018Okay, that s interesting. Most drivers are going to have smartphones very soon. If they all have devices, the dispatcher could track them with GPS, send them work in real time and optimize routes in a more dynamic way,'\u201d Naim said. \u201cThe \u2018last mile  costs and complexities associated with delivery, especially for newcomers, are difficult to manage. Onfleet s technology helps businesses streamline this onerous undertaking by efficiently connecting businesses, dispatchers, drivers and deliveries to happy customers.\u201dOnfleet offers a dashboard for dispatching where users can optimize routes and search for drivers and deliveries or pickups. The platform recommends routes accounting for factors like time, location, capacity and traffic, and can auto-assign tasks to drivers.Onfleet also provides status updates to customers including real-time driver tracking and proof of delivery. On the back end, managers \u2014 who can chat with drivers via the platform \u2014 see performance metrics like on-time rates, service times, feedback scores and more.\u201cOnfleet leverages machine learning for driver optimization and prediction, providing operations teams and consumers to-the-minute information, decision automation and proactive notifications. We derive a dataset by analyzing location data for delivery segments and filtering anomalous segments \u2014 we ve collected around 500 million miles of anonymized driver location data comprising tens of billions of data points,\u201d Naim said. \u201cOur predictive ETA feature was the first significant application currently of this data. We re working on more refined models to better predict travel time and operational parameters and aspects of the delivery process, such as parking and building entry time.\u201dImage Credits: OnfleetSome drivers might object to that kind of telemetry, particularly in light of recent reporting on the travails of third-party delivery fleets. For example, according to a recent study by the Strategic Organizing Center, nearly one in five drivers making deliveries for Amazon suffered injuries in 2021 as they faced punishing quotas and pressure to ferry packages as quickly as possible.Naim, though, argues that Onfleet merely offers a way to help underperformers improve at a time when there s a severe shortage of drivers. The U.S. alone is experiencing a shortfall of more than 80,000 truck drivers, the American Trucking Associations estimates \u2014 a number that s expected to climb as delivery demand climbs.\u201cWe want to make it easy for small- and medium-sized businesses to track the value they add to their business by offering delivery,\u201d Naim said. \u201cThe driver shortage has plagued the transportation, logistics and delivery industry for years, and the pandemic worsened the impact it has. With the talent shortage, the prioritization of work/life balance since drivers spend more time away from home and the skills gap given the profession can require special training such as truck licenses, etc, it s getting harder to find people to hire for these types of roles. Our platform supports businesses in this area with automated route optimization, so they can monitor activity and reduce the number of drivers needed at any given time.Naim wasn t willing to peel back the curtain on Onfleet s financials, but he claimed the company is \u201con track for continued growth\u201d as it attempts to differentiate itself from rivals such as Wise Systems, Routific\u00a0and Bringg. Within the year, San Francisco, California-based Onfleet plans to expand its workforce from 120 people to around 150.",

        "title": "With ride-hail and delivery launch, Fenix wants to be the Bolt of the Middle East",
        "text": "Abu Dhabi-based mobility startup Fenix has added ride-hail and courier services to its portfolio of mobility products.The company launched \u201cFenix Taxi\u201d in Manama, Bahrain, on Monday and says it s planning to add two additional markets this summer. At the same time, Fenix launched its \u201cFenix Genie\u201d service, which allows users to \u201cbuy anything and get anything delivered\u201d within minutes in select neighborhoods of Abu Dhabi, Istanbul, Mersin and Doha, according to the startup. Couriers deliver goods using a combination of Fenix s shared e-scooters and internal e-mopeds.Since Fenix s founding as a shared e-scooter operator in 2020, the company has regularly added business lines, from 10-minute grocery delivery to micromobility subscriptions to, now, ride-hail. It s a similar playbook to the likes of Bolt in Europe and Yandex in Russia and Israel, one that \u201cleverages what we think is the superpower of micromobility, which is a great way to get customers onto the platform and organically adopt us and then offer complimentary services,\u201d Jaideep Dhanoa, co-founder and CEO of Fenix, told TechCrunch.Fenix launches ride-hailing service in Bahrain.\u00a0Image Credits:\u00a0Fenix\u201cHaving worked in the industry for about eight years now, I know that one product can t solve all mobility needs because our needs are diverse as a populace and even on a per trip basis,\u201d continued Dhanoa.All of Fenix s products and services are available in the same app, the goal being to create one \u201cmobility super app\u201d to serve the greater Middle East. Aside from Bahrain, Qatar, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, Fenix also has a presence in Saudi Arabia, specifically with its shared and subscription scooter service.\u201cOur mission is to unleash urban potential and propel communities forward,\u201d said Dhanoa. \u201cWe start with mobility, which is an enabler for opportunity. Mobility, it gets people to work, to school, to the mall, it gets you home. When people move and do more, it drives economic activity and quality of living, so we re really focused on how we can reduce that friction to move.\u201dDhanoa says piling on the products and services has been the strategy from the get-go. The CEO s co-founder, IQ Sayed, was formerly the head of engineering at Careem, a Middle Eastern ride-hailing service that Uber acquired. That experience taught Sayed to think about the technological architecture of Fenix s product as something that could continually be added to, rather than re-engineered every time the company decided to add a new business line.\u201cWe incorporated those lessons into how we ve built up the tech at Fenix from day one, and it s really paying dividends as we re now able to spin out new products basically every quarter with a very lean, high-velocity tech team,\u201d said Dhanoa.Publicly, Fenix has only raised $5 million, most, if not all, of which probably went toward the company s purchase of Turkish e-scooter operator Palm. Dhanoa says Fenix has raised more money that it hasn t yet announced to help it scale and expand. Otherwise, the company is mainly relying on profits from its core micromobility business to fund these new business lines.Delivery workers for Fenix Genie ride Fenix s shared e-scooters.\u00a0Image Credit:\u00a0Fenix\u201cWe are profitable in all five of our markets on a unit economic basis,\u201d said Dhanoa. \u201cI think market selection is also important. The Gulf specifically has a really large profit pool for ops-intensive businesses just due to labor arbitrage. We have developed market pricing with emerging market costs and low competitive intensity.\u201dIn the near term, Fenix is focused on bringing its full portfolio of mobility and delivery products to the footprint where it currently operates shared e-scooters so it can leverage existing brand stickiness. Dhanoa says Fenix is also working to expand its e-scooter presence in current markets.Looking further out, Fenix wants its footprint to cover the greater Middle Eastern region, from Morocco to Pakistan.\u201cThis is a region with similar characteristics to Southeast Asia \u2014 large population but diverse and highly fragmented \u2014 that requires tremendous management attention to unlock, creating the opportunity for a regional champion,\u201d said Dhanoa.",

        "title": "Unlikely players team up to lead South Korea s air taxi industry",
        "text": "The United States is perhaps one of the best countries to start an urban air mobility company. You only have to look at how fast well-funded startups like Joby Aviation, Wisk Aero and Lillium are building and testing electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft.However, South Korea, which lacks the venture capital, entrepreneurial ecosystem and aerospace legacy of the U.S., might be the first to lay the groundwork for taking urban air mobility (UAM) from an expensive science project into a viable service.In 2020, the South Korean government set out its road map to commercialize air taxis by 2025, a goal that has since empowered mobility-focused private companies to form consortia dedicated to that end. Now, in addition to carmakers, seemingly unlikely players \u2014 think telecommunications companies and ride-sharing platforms \u2014 are pushing the UAM industry forward.The unusual suspectsIt s not a stretch to imagine automakers getting involved in this space. Indeed, some American companies like General Motors\u00a0have air mobility in their sights. After all, they have the brand recognition and the manufacturing might to at least get a vehicle off the production line.In South Korea, Hyundai, the country s biggest carmaker, has earmarked KRW 1.8 trillion ($1.4 billion) for flying taxis in South Korea by 2025. The company in 2020 also formed a consortium with South Korean telco giant KT and a couple other companies to commercialize UAMs by 2028 and build the country s first vertiport at the Millennium Hilton Seoul.Now, you re probably wondering how telecommunications firms fit into this equation. Predictably, it appears they fill out the communications part of the puzzle.",

        "title": "The delivery market is coming down from its pandemic highs",
        "text": "During the pandemic, delivery startups \u2014 whether focused on groceries, essentials or takeout \u2014 became the darling children of venture capital firms. Early on, mandates and closures put up barriers to physical shopping, but as time went on, customers became more used to the idea of shopping online for everything from toilet paper to rotisserie chicken. In a 2021 survey from Coresight Research, nearly two-thirds of U.S. consumers \u2014 60% \u2014 said that they were buying groceries online, up from 36.8% in 2019.Delivery companies old and new reaped the benefits of the changed landscape. In 2020, a 500% increase in order volume drove Instacart s revenue to $1.5 billion \u2014 attracting $1 billion in capital at a $39 billion valuation in 2021. On-demand grocery delivery startup Gorillas nabbed $290 million at a $1 billion valuation that same year. Within the span of a few months, Berlin-based instant grocery startup Flink secured $750 million at a $2.85 billion post-money valuation, while Gopuff, a U.S.-based rival, raised $1 billion on a $15 billion valuation.According a report from AgFunder, total venture investment for \u201ce-grocery\u201d companies reached $18.5 billion in 2021. Between 2020 and 2022, investors poured more than $5.5 billion into New York City-based instant delivery companies alone, a separate analysis found.The boom continued into early 2022, with startups like Getir, Zapp and Zepto raising mammoth rounds. But there are signs of a correction. Instacart, citing \u201cmarket turbulence,\u201d last month slashed its valuation by 40% and slowed hiring. Publicly traded DoorDash and Deliveroo have seen their stock prices fluctuate wildly over the past year. (DoorDash executed a $400 million stock buyback program in May.) Gorillas, Getir, Zapp and Gopuff are among other delivery startups that have let go staff in recent months, despite fundraising. Some have been forced to shut down entirely, like Fridge No More, 1520 and Buyk.The delivery sector can t be painted with a broad brush, necessarily. But \u2014 taken together \u2014 the developments suggest that the pandemic period of rapid growth is coming to an end.\u201cSome [delivery startups] are most certainly safe \u2014 especially the ones with positive unit economics,\u201d Matt Birnbaum, the former head of talent acquisition at Instacart and now a talent partner at Pear VC, told TechCrunch via email. \u201cThe good delivery companies can slow their spend in growth areas like hiring and marketing and become profitable almost immediately. The companies that are in the most danger are the ones who don t have a clear path to profitability in the short or medium term. As access to capital has become more constrained, so has the appetite for growth at all costs.\u201dCraft Ventures partner and co-founder Jeff Fluhr, the ex-CEO of StubHub, didn t mince words about the delivery market s woes. (Craft Ventures has invested in several delivery startups, including Shef, which enables home cooks to sell their food for delivery.) He blamed \u201cultra-fast delivery\u201d marketplaces \u2014 i.e. those promising food, drinks and household items delivered in roughly 30 minutes or less \u2014 for dragging the overall segment down with low or negative gross margins, owing to the \u201cvery high\u201d human labor expenses relative to the margin from\u00a0product and transaction fees.\u201cThe fast delivery space is the epitome of exuberance of 2021: investors were pouring money into cash guzzling companies with flimsy business models,\u201d he told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cFast delivery companies are capital-intensive. They require local infrastructure, local people, and local operations which are expensive to build out. As a result, all of these companies have been incinerating boatloads of cash over the past 12 to 24 months as they ve expanded to new geographic markets. Of course consumers like the instant gratification of a pint of ice cream in 15 minutes, so revenues grew quickly, driven by a great consumer experience and word-of-mouth virality. Investors followed the growth paying no attention to the potential for profitability. But the notion that a startup can deliver on that promise profitably is a pipe dream.\u201dTo Fluhr s point, even for firms that buy goods at wholesale prices and sell them at a markup (unlike, for example, Instacart and GrubHub, which act as an intermediary between storefronts and end-customers), ultra-fast delivery has sky-high operating costs. Jokr, a New York-based grocery deliver venture, was reportedly losing $13.6 million on just $1.7 million worth of sales in 2021. Delivery vehicles as well as contract labor, including drivers and those responsible for packing or picking orders, are an outsize line item \u2014 poor pay and benefits or no. So are the leased storefronts, warehouses and fulfillment centers, called \u201cdark stores,\u201d that companies like Gorillas operate to meet their delivery pledges, which contribute to waste such as unsold perishables.Buyt claimed to have roughly 800 dark stores in 25 cities at its peak. Getir has roughly 1,100.Rafael Ilishayev, Gopuff s co-CEO and co-founder, told CNBC in May that the company s business model is predicated on in-app advertising for brands and \u201cmaking margins on products.\u201d But promotions and marketing are eating away at these margins. According to The Wall Street Journal, Fridge No More spent $70 on advertising to win the average customer, an investment that resulted in a $78 loss for every customer that stayed from December 2020 through September 2021.Birnbaum pegs the blame, too, on reckless hiring. During the pandemic, high-growth tech companies adopted a \u201cgotta-catch- em-all\u201d approach to hiring, he said, making headcount decisions with the goal of accumulating as many \u201cassets\u201d as possible. Birnbaum was referring to technical hiring, but, on the general subject of hiring, Instacart added hundreds of thousands of gig workers to meet the surging demand early in the pandemic \u2014 demand which has since dropped off.\u201cAs companies look at their balance sheets, they re focusing their bets and no longer need to hire at the same pace they ve been hiring over the last few years; hence hiring freezes,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies that fail to adjust or don t have adequate runway to support their current headcount are going to be in an entirely different situation.\u201dTechCrunch contacted a sampling of delivery companies to inquire about hiring status, including DoorDash, Delivery.com, Grubub, Grab, Deliveroo, Just Eat Takeaway and Delivery Hero. Several declined to comment or didn t respond, but respective spokespeople for DoorDash and Grubhub said that the companies haven t made any adjustments to their hiring plans.\u201cI think that, in general, it comes down to the model and whether it works or not full stop,\u201d Rob Kniaz, a partner at Hoxton Ventures, told TechCrunch via email. Hoxton was an early investor in Deliveroo and recently led a funding round in Bother, a next-day delivery startup based in the U.K. \u201cDoorDash seems to work by whacking on fees to all parties to cover the operation costs. The \u2018quick commerce  companies [like Gopuff] were competing on price and speed and have lower basket sizes to boot, so it s much harder for them to reach a breakeven point. I think the model works where you can get away with very high margins and/or delivery fees, but this will never be an everyday, low-price model. It s a luxury business in my opinion.\u201dA few surveys support the notion that delivery customers are a fickle bunch. One of the most pessimistic, out of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, suggests that over 90% of people who used online delivery services during the pandemic would likely revert back to their original way of shopping.\u201cWhen general market sentiment turned in the past few months, investors started scrutinizing profitability and cash flow. Investors who were once funding this segment are now rejecting it, full stop,\u201d Fluhr said. \u201cAs these companies faced the reality in the past few months that there would be no more free money, they realized they needed to cut burn, extend their runway, and have the benefit of more time to figure out a business model with better unit economics. That s why we re seeing so many layoffs in the fast delivery space in particular \u2026 The layoffs and hiring freezes have really only just begun and will likely get worse before they get better.\u201dPundits say it s history repeating itself. In the  90s, California-based Webvan, one of the first rapid grocery delivery startups, was briefly valued at $7.9 billion before going bust. Rivals Kozmo and Urbanfetch went out of business after losses mounted.But compounding the challenges delivery startups today face is the wider economic downturn. Inflation continues unabated, driving up food, rent and transportation costs. Supply chain disruptions threaten to delay the shipment of goods such as baby formula. And investors are increasingly wary of capital-intensive bets, preferring instead to put money toward segments like business software.\u201cIf each delivery has negative unit economics, the only savior will be massive scale, which will drive down costs,\u201d Phil Haslett, the co-founder and chief strategy officer at EquityZen, told TechCrunch via email. \u201cGetting to massive scale requires massive amounts of capital. In the current market environment, that s a tough sell to venture capital and growth equity investors.\u201dConsolidation is on the horizon \u2014 and indeed, has already begun. Just Eat Takeaway paid $7.3 billion for Grubhub. DoorDash bought rival food delivery app Caviar from Square and recently snapped up Wolt in an all-stock deal. In 2020, ahead of its purchases of grocery delivery startups Cornershop and Drizly, Uber finalized its acquisition of Postmates. And last year, Gopuff \u2014 which has a partnership with Uber \u2014 acquired Fancy and Dija.Expect business models to change, too. Jokr and Buyk are introducing longer delivery times in order to fulfill more orders per drive. Before it went out of business, Fridge No More was looking to obtain a liquor license and invest in more private-label products for delivery customers. FastAF, a relative newcomer in the delivery space, specializes in high-priced and luxury items.\u201cThe shifting of the goal posts will introduce discipline into this space,\u201d Fluhr said. \u201cCompanies will need to figure out a model that works or else die. Most will die, but perhaps a few will land on a new model that balances the value prop for the consumer with a model that can actually generate a profit.\u201dDelivery companies could trim losses by increasing prices, selling their own brands, and driving up order sizes with pricier items like alcohol, investors say. Or they could invest in technology like robotics fulfillment, enabling couriers to carry more orders per trip.\u201cI think these models are reflective of the market in the sense businesses with tight or negative margins will be the first to take on water,\u201d Kniaz said. \u201cThat said, I think there are other interesting models of distribution that are just taking off that have lower variable costs compared to guys on a scooter delivering a banana for \u00a31. We ve done a few things like PillSorted and Bother that actually make sense in a down market where value is a factor as well as convenience.\u201dJared Carmel, a managing partner at Manhattan Venture Partners, an investor in Instacart and Postmates, added: \u201cWhen it comes to startup investing, we aren t evaluating our investments by vertical alone. We can expect to see some consolidation in this space and some startups are going to fare better than others. But in the long term, the pandemic served to change consumer habits. People got used to ordering groceries during lockdown and now they recognize the importance of and financial value of the time they save by not going shopping. As far as differentiating delivery startups, we re keeping an eye on delivery startups with strong e-commerce and advertising plays and startups whose base structure doesn t rely on realestate plays, like renting out local warehouse space.\u201d",

        "title": "Mexico City s Kolors wants to disrupt intercity busing in Latin America",
        "text": "Kolors, a Mexico City-based startup, says its platform that connects intercity bus riders with bus drivers is like \u201cif Uber and Southwest Airlines had a baby.\u201dLike Uber and other ride-hailing platforms, Kolors doesn t own any of its own vehicles, but rather partners with small and medium-sized bus operators that are already running scheduled services. And like Southwest and other airlines, passengers are coddled by a bus attendant, a Kolors employee who checks in passengers, accepts payments of cash when needed, and sells snacks and drinks.In emerging markets, similar products are creeping up to address what Kolors CEO and co-founder Rodrigo Mart\u00ednez says is something of an antiquated industry. In Africa and the Middle East, Treepz and Swvl use a similar model for both intra- and intercity bus travel, minus the bus attendant. Part of the push to digitalize the bus industry is because the technology exists now. But as GDP in emerging markets rises, so do the expectations of consumers for higher-quality products, making busing, the lifeblood of countries like Mexico, the perfect industry to disrupt.\u201cPeople are wanting more, they re demanding more for the services,\u201d Mart\u00ednez told TechCrunch. \u201cThe new bus passenger is millennials and centennials who want a better service than the incumbents can provide. Companies like Greyhound have been around for over a hundred years, and that one was purchased by Flixbus, a nine-year-old startup. It s all about seeing what technology and data-driven optimization can do for the services.\u201dKolors bus attendants are on every ride to check in passengers and provide snacks and beverages.\u00a0Image Credit:\u00a0KolorsKolors estimates the intercity busing industry is worth over $100 billion, with a $20 billion potential in Latin America alone.\u00a0 Clearly, big-name investors in the mobility are also convinced of the potential behind this underrated industry, because the startup just closed out a $20 million Series A, bringing its total funding up to $26 million. The round was led by UP.Partners with participation from Toyota Ventures, Maniv Mobility, K5 Global and Mazapil, as well as existing investors. Kolors will use the funds to deepen its coverage in Mexico and parts of the U.S., as well as expand into other Latin American countries, likely starting with Chile.Most of that funding will go toward improving the company s tech backend, a \u201csmart bus platform\u201d that is based on a combination of airline and ride-hailing technology and allows for route optimization, booking, scheduling, pricing, marketing, sales and customer service, the company says.The platform also collects data on things like which products passengers are buying from bus attendants while on board. Mart\u00ednez says Kolors will also sell \u201cancillary products and services\u201d as a means to accrue different revenue streams, like an airline would.It s the customer experience and the touch of luxury that Kolors is focusing on, says Mart\u00ednez. Kolors only works with bus operators that drive coach or luxury buses with free WiFi. The higher-end buses will be equipped with seats that can fully recline for overnight drives, something that is really non-negotiable if you re on a 30-hour bus ride from Tijuana to Mexico City.\u201cThe bus attendant helps us to not only provide a better experience for our passengers, but also ensure the quality of every single Kolors trip,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez. \u201cBecause at the end of the day, they re not our buses, we don t employ the bus drivers because they re employed by their bus company. But the attendant allows us to make sure that every single Kolors experience is the same or very similar, no matter who the partner is or what bus it is.\u201d",

        "title": "Yummy s super-sized round helps grow its delivery, ride-sharing super app in LatAm",
        "text": "Less than a year after taking its first funding, Latin American local on-demand delivery and transportation super app Yummy is back with an upsized round of $47 million.The round was led by Anthos Capital, with the participation of JAM Fund, Soma Capital, WIND Ventures, Ethos Capital and YC Continuity. The new investment gives Yummy a total of $69 million in funding to date.Yummy was founded in 2020 by CEO Vicente Zavarce, a Venezuelan native and former Postmates and Getaround director of user acquisition. It started out as a food-delivery app and was part of Y Combinator s summer 2021 cohort.Today, the free super app provides delivery of items \u2014 from food to medicine to clothing \u2014 ride-sharing, grocery delivery in under 20 minutes and the purchase of experiences like concerts and sporting events. The company has also moved on from its initial markets of Venezuela and Bolivia and into Peru and Panama, Zavarce told TechCrunch. In addition, it partnered with quick-serve restaurants, including KFC, Arturo s and Burger Shack to provide exclusive offerings for customers.This latest investment is nearly three times higher than the amount Yummy announced last October. Around this time last year, the company had about 200,000 registered super app users, and that now sits at 2.5 million users, Zavarce said. It is also providing thousands of gig worker jobs in the region.Yummy app Image Credits: YummyYummy bags $18M as its expands delivery app across Latin AmericaFor its grocery business, Zavarce s goal last year was to have 50 active dark stores by the end of 2022. It has 21 of its own microfulfillment centers and also works with partner-owned facilities. Meanwhile, Zavarce tells me the ride-sharing business, which includes both motorcycle and car options, became the first of Yummy s business units to achieve profitability.Altogether, Yummy is working with over 8,000 merchants, processing 800,000 monthly transactions across its markets and growing over 40% quarter over quarter. The average cart size varies per category, but on the prepared food side, it is $14, while groceries are $30.With the new capital, Yummy plans to invest in product development, increasing density within its current categories and expanding coverage in its more mature markets, including Venezuela and Bolivia.The company initially started in Panama and Peru with groceries, but now that it has had some success there, Zavarce expects to expand more categories.\u201cThis round is going to focus on going deeper where we already are,\u201d he added. \u201cWe realize that e-commerce penetration in Latin America is still low, and we have also identified access to modern financial services as a need and opportunity for us.\u201dZavarce noted that he didn t want to speak too early on what plans for the financial services would look like, but he did reveal that with consumers using the Yummy app to purchase food and groceries, \u201cthere is no reason why we couldn t add a fintech layer to make everyday life in Yummy easier.\u201dOnline food delivery in Latin America continues to grow, and Statista estimated the market grew 30% in 2019 and 2020, valuing it at about $6.8 billion. That is poised to be a $9.3 billion sector by 2026.The market there is dominated by companies like Rappi, whose valuation is $5.2 billion from its last funding round; Uber Eats; iFood; and J\u00fcsto, which raised $152 million in Series B funding in April. A market that big is also attracting younger startups like Orchata.Zavarce believes what will separate Yummy from its competitors is the group of people leading the company. As part of the investment, Barney Harford, former COO of Uber Technologies and CEO of Orbitz Worldwide, was appointed to the Yummy board of directors.\u201cWe have identified a way to grow a sustainable business, and having the former Uber COO joining the board is just strengthening the platform around me,\u201d Zavarce added.Last-mile delivery in Latin America is ready to take off",

        "title": "Boundary Layer wants to steal air freight s lunch and transport it by water instead",
        "text": "If you ve ever spent time writing beat poetry about container ships chugging their way into and out of harbors, \u201cnimble\u201d or \u201cfast\u201d will be unlikely to make it into your finely crafted written words. And if your (admittedly increasingly esoteric) poetic bent is more of an air freight persuasion, it s likely that \u201caffordable\u201d was not in your lexicon. Boundary Layer is working on a series of electrically propulsed hydrofoiling vessels and wants to rewrite the book of transportation-focused verse, one stanza at a time, with nimble, fast-to-load, container-ship standard high-speed shipping vessels, with the goal of halving the cost of traditional air freight, at comparable speeds.The company raised $4.8 million from Lower Carbon Capital, Fifty Years and Soma Capital, and already has $90 million in pre-orders from ferry operators for their 220-seat electric passenger vessels. The passenger ships are but a launchpad before the company goes after its real goal: the freight market. I spoke with Boundary Layer s CEO and founder, Ed Kearney, who told me that these early vessels are a launchpad to enter the $100 billion air freight market with a high-speed hydrogen-powered container ship.\u201cWe applied to Y Combinator and were accepted. We told the partners in the interview that if we were accepted into Y Combinator, we would come to the Bay Area, and we d build a hydrofoil container ship that carries one container,\u201d says Kearney. The Y Combinator team called bullshit, he tells me. The team rolled up their sleeves and got to work. \u201cWe turned up with some hand tools in our luggage, no workshop, nowhere to live, and started building. Ten weeks later, we managed to build this hydrofoil. We spent $150,000 on it, which happened to be exactly the amount of money that YC gives you. We parked out in front of the demo day facility and it made a bit of an impact.\u201dIt s easy to see how; the company s prototype ship \u2014 and the video it produced to show it off \u2014 looks pretty slick:The challenge with hydrofoiling, of course, is that you need a fair bit of energy to get the ship s hull out of the water \u2014 and that s harder the heavier the ship gets. The world s largest cargo ships can transport some 24,000 containers in one go. Needless to say, those behemoths aren t going to casually lift their hulls out of the water \u2014 but that s also not what the company is competing with.\u201cThe physics [of hydrofoiling] is very similar to that of an aircraft. The amount of the lift-to-drag ratio that you get with modern materials on a hydrofoil wing these days are about the same as what you can get from a traditional airplane. So the amount of power you need to make a vehicle have the same amount of mass takeoff is also kind of comparable. Also the amount of thrust you need scales with speed,\u201d Kearney explains. \u201cAn aircraft travels at 500 knots \u2014 we travel 40 \u2014 but they still need 12 times more power. In a nutshell, the way we solved it was by taking a smaller vessel, you get very weight-conscious, and you need a large amount of power. That means we need big fuel cells and batteries.\u201dThe company s vision is not to replace conventional ocean freight, the freight rates \u2014 that would be madness; the price of ocean freight is incredibly low, which is why around 90% of all goods consumed in the world are shipped this way. The company tells me that the local trucking \u2014 which takes the container the last few hundred miles of its journey \u2014 can be more expensive than the 6,000-mile ocean journey.\u201cWe will be making container ships, but we re not competing with container ships. We are replacing air freight. Think of components and other goods they are shipping by air freight. They are already paying very high freight rates of $2-3 per kilogram,\u201d Kearney explains. \u201cInter Asia is the most exciting market for us, because it s the biggest market in terms of air freight. Those customers already have very high-value goods that need to move quickly and we re able to offer them an alternative to air freight that s half the price and comparable transit times.\u201dThe battery pack on Boundary Layer s prototype clocks in at 95 KWh and 415 Volts \u2014 very similar to what you might find in a high-end performance electric car (the Tesla Model 3 Performance packs an 82 kWh 350 V lithium-ion pack, for example). Image Credits: Boundary LayerOf course, a plane is going to out-fly a ship cruising at sea every day of the week, but Boundary Layer believes that high speed and the use of standard containers makes it competitive. The crux of the matter is that containerized transportation can make shipping an order of magnitude more efficient. A manufacturer in Taiwan can fill a 20- or 40-foot container with whatever they need to ship, put it on a truck, move it to one of Boundary Layer s high-speed container ships, then put it on a truck in South Korea and have it delivered to the assembly plant. All of this can happen without unloading and re-loading the container \u2014 which can be locked and sealed for the whole journey. When shipping by air, even if the goods are on pallets, the company claims there are significant inefficiencies.If you really want to nerd out about why containerized commerce is such a benefit, there s an incredible eight-part podcast series that ll have you transfixed for a few hours. One for the transportation nerds. Anyway \u2014 back to Boundary Layer\u2026\u201cWe ve got three Fortune 500 companies as launch partners \u2014 one is in the electronics space, one in the automotive supply and one is in the electronic equipment space,\u201d claims Kearney, who declined to name the companies for now, but claims those three partners have $26 million worth of letters of intent (LOI), and an additional $60 million in pre-orders for the passenger ferries, spanning the world: \u201cThe passenger ferry customers will be announced soon, but they re all over the world, including the Mediterranean, the US, as well as the Caribbean\u201dBoundary Layer created a video to show off its passenger ferry:The company makes a big deal out of its vehicles being zero-emission.\u201cAll our vessels will be zero-emissions, and propulsion ultimately comes from electric motors. The passenger ferry will just have lithium-ion batteries powering the electric system,\u201d says Kearney. \u201cFor the container ship, we need to have a range of 1,500 nautical miles. Batteries only really get you to about 100 nautical miles, so for cargo, we are doing liquid hydrogen. That will even get us to 10,000 nautical miles if you wanted to have very large tanks. The electric system between the passenger ferry and the cargo ship will be identical. What differs is where the electrical power comes from.\u201d",

        "title": "The US is about to get serious about EVs",
        "text": "For most of the last decade, Americans largely ignored electric vehicles. Some brands sold decent numbers, like the Chevy Bolt or Nissan Leaf, but they were largely targeted at thrifty commuters or EV diehards. Others, like the Ford Focus Electric, were intended only to comply with laws that mandated a small number of EV sales. Still others, like the early Tesla models, were desirable but out of reach for most people.In the last couple of years, though, automakers have dropped their resistance and consumers have likewise let go of their indifference. New technology adoption often follows an S-curve, where people are slow to embrace it at first but then rush in once a tipping point is reached. EVs appear to be at that inflection point today: Car buyers snapped up nearly twice as many plug-in vehicles last year as they did the year before.The sudden surge has observers wondering whether the pace can be maintained, especially in the U.S. Their concern isn t misplaced: Apart from Tesla s factories, the U.S. doesn t have significant EV or battery manufacturing infrastructure, at least not yet. And in terms of publicly available chargers, we have fewer per road-going EV than any country but Norway, where the public s sudden embrace of EVs has led to a wave of new registrations, according to a recent International Energy Agency report. Innovation may help position U.S. battery makers to be more independent of Chinese supply chains, an agenda that s been top of mind for many manufacturers.The U.S. may seem behind, but is it hopelessly so? Can the country pull a rabbit out of the hat? It s happened before, of course. The U.S. didn t invent the automobile \u2014 that honor goes to Germany s Karl Benz \u2014 but it did produce the Model T, which helped the country take the lead in the adoption of the automobile.Neither was the Interstate Highway System the first controlled-access highway network, but today it s far more extensive than the Autobahn, and until a decade ago, was the most extensive in the world. The trend holds outside transportation, too \u2014 Americans didn t embrace mobile phones at first, but subscription rates continue to grow domestically while they ve plateaued or dropped in more zealous countries.It s not guaranteed, but there are plenty of reasons why the U.S. has a good chance of catching up in the race. And if it does, it ll mean plenty of opportunities for investors, especially on the infrastructure side.",

        "text": "French startup Upway has raised a $25 million Series A round led by Exor Seeds and Sequoia Capital. The company sells secondhand electric bikes that have been refurbished and are ready to roll.In many ways, Upway reminds me of online marketplaces for cars. The startup provides a seamless experience for buyers who want to buy an electric bike but don t want to pay the full price of a new electric bike.Behind the scenes, Upway buys electric bikes from both consumers and companies. The team brings those bikes to its warehouse, checks them, repairs them in some cases and lists them on their website. Of course, Upway tries to generate a small margin on every sale.In addition to Exor Seeds and Sequoia Capital, Origins is also participating in today s round. Origins is the VC firm backed by many professional soccer players, such as Blaise Matuidi, Olivier Giroud, N golog Kant\u00e9, as well as Antoine Dupont (a rugbyman).Existing investor Global Founders Capital is investing once again in the startup. Henri Moissinac, the co-founder and CEO of micromobility startup Dott, is joining the round as well.Right now, the startup operates in its home country France and Belgium. Bikes are shipped directly to customers from the same warehouse in Gennevilliers near Paris. But the company is already thinking about its next moves.Upway will soon launch its marketplace in Germany, the Netherlands and the U.S. By the end of 2022, the company will have three different warehouses.Sales of electric bikes have been growing rapidly in Europe. Manufacturers are benefiting from this boom, including some startups that have raised massive rounds, such as Cowboy and VanMoof. But they remain expensive goods and they also suffer from supply chain constraints.Bikes (electric or not) will play an important role in the future of urban mobility in major European cities. That s why it s important to provide new ways to access bikes. Electric bikes more specifically can even replace many car rides outside of major hubs.Some cities have invested heavily in subsidized bike-sharing services, such as V\u00e9lib  in Paris. Some companies, like Dott, are buying thousands of electric bikes for their free-floating bike rental services.How four European cities are embracing micromobility to drive out carsCompanies like Swapfiets and Dance are also important when it comes to democratizing electric bikes. These startups let you rent a bike for a flat monthly subscription fee. When you cancel your subscription, you hand out the bike.Coming back to Upway, people who want to use an electric bike to go to work or ride to school may consider getting their own bike. In addition to new bikes, it s important to provide different offerings.Upway makes electric bikes more affordable. All bikes come with a one-year warranty and there s no stock issue as the company only lists electric bikes that it can sell right way. Some customers can also take advantage of Alma to buy now and pay later in multiple installments without any interest.The startup also provides accessories, such as helmets, lights, bike locks and child seats. Eventually, you could also imagine adding some insurance product to your basket before checking out.Overall, Upway sells 400 different models from brands like Moustache, O2feel, Keola, Veloci, Arcade, Cowboy and VanMoof. There are currently 20 million electric bikes on the European and American roads. Those millions of bikes could all end up on a secondhand marketplace like Upway. And I m not surprised that the startup managed to raise another $25 million.Image Credits: Upway",

        "title": "Felt s $15 million chance to prove that maps are the next big medium",
        "text": "Despite economic turmoil in the tech world, an Oakland-based startup shows that moonshots are still getting funded. Felt, co-founded by Sam Hashemi and Can Duruk, wants to disrupt the role of maps in society, and rethink how we think about the medium. The startup allows users to build a map with datasets integrated into it, and work with each other to showcase impact in a less static way than your average Google maps query.Despite a massive mission \u2014 proving that maps are a forgotten yet fundamental medium worth renovating \u2014 the co-founders cited proven business models from Figma and Notion, both valued in the billions, as reason to believe in their work. The aforementioned companies both succeeded in rolling out to users for personal use, then pivoting to the enterprise, a playbook that Felt wants to follow (and that VCs can certainly speak the language of).\u201cThat kind of business model and go to market is \u2014 I don t want to say immune, but is a little bit removed from the kind of market fluctuations we re seeing,\u201d Hashemi said. \u201cIt s really not about consumer spending, it s not about an advertising business, it s just day in day out work that businesses are relying on.\u201dThe argument worked. Today, the collaborative software startup tells TechCrunch that it recently closed a $15 million Series A led by Footwork, with participation from Bain Capital Ventures, Moxxie Ventures and Designer Fund.Since its seed round, a $4.5 million investment announced in August 2021, Felt has grown its team from seven people to 15 people across Hawaii, California, Missouri, Vermont, Canada and Spain. One of Felt s team members \u2014 Mamata Akella \u2014 is even an in-house cartographer \u2014 a job title you don t too often see as part of the early-stage startup ranks.The funding, and team growth, means that Felt thinks it is ready for the next phase of growth: feedback. The startup launched its platform publicly today after weeks of private beta testing with over 1,000 people. The public beta combined 50 layers of data, such as earthquake history or wildfire data, with a clean interface meant to empower people to draw their own maps. That in and of itself is a feat, the co-founders say, given that data is often fragmented, inaccurate or just straight-up badly formatted.Image Credits: FeltFelt is meant to be a continuation of the collaborative software movement underscored by everyday tools like Google Docs and top companies like Notion and Figma, as well as a sequel to Hashemi s previous company, Remix. Bought by Via for $100 million, Remix is a city transportation planning startup born out of Code for America Hackathon. Felt was the follow-up story, this time taking mapping beyond cities. From August to now, the co-founders say that Felt went from a tech demo to a product with more \u201ccommercial legs,\u201d including richer, fact-checked datasets, fewer bugs and, hopefully, a faster load time.Felt launched with a climate-focused angle, yet that focus feels broader today. Hashemi said that the company is also investing in ways to serve other use cases, such as the sciences need to understand ocean landscape, or the national park s wanting a better way to track trails.Image Credits: FeltDuruk said they no longer view climate as a single industry, but instead as more of a horizontal idea. \u201cNow, every single industry that has a physical presence on Earth has to have climate and weather and fires and floods in mind\u2026it impacts everything.\u201d One example that Hashemi offered up was how maps can help people fleeing the war in Ukraine. How do people offer up houses, get matched or see what s available?A lot of these collaboration use cases, he explained, \u201crequire a larger audience using the product and pushing the boundaries.\u201dThe next chapter should help Felt with prioritizing which features to launch next or identifying surprising use cases, but it should also give it the pressure to answer some of its most looming challenges, such as how to moderate maps or build processes that limit bad actors. These are massive questions to answer before maps can become the next big medium. The startup is launching with a moderation-first approach in the beginning, banning any kind of criminal and illegal activity such as \u201cthe next insurrection map.\u201d Duruk thinks that the public launch will show what gaps they have in their understanding.\u201cYou need to moderate,\u201d said Duruk, who previously worked at Uber and data security company VGS. \u201cI do not believe in opening something up to the world just filled with hopes and dreams, a small number of bad actors can make the experience awful for everyone and turn the platform into a bad place.\u201dThe startup has some well-powered competition. Other than Google Maps and Apple maps, social maps app Zenly, a company owned by Snap, recently announced that it is creating its own mapping data and engine. After three years of work, Zenly wants to integrate social data and mapping data into one frame; focusing less on being \u201cpixel perfect\u201d and more on rolling out a different type of map.For Felt, this is both competition and an affirmation. While Zenly is going for consumers, Felt wants to be enterprise ready. The success of both efforts depends on the world s appetite for a new way to map their thoughts. Even if it requires more than going from point A to point B.",

        "title": "SWVL plans to lay off 32% of its team two months after going public",
        "text": "Egypt-born and Dubai-headquartered mobility startup SWVL is planning to lay off 32% of its workforce it said in a statement today.The company s LinkedIn profile shows it has over 1,330 employees. Letting go of over 30% of its workforce means that around 400 people will lose their jobs at the mobility company.Tech companies, private and public, have faced a reckoning in the past few months with their valuations taking a beating. The effect of an economic downturn has also affected their finances leading them to cut costs; the top of the list is letting go of employees.This downsizing from the Dubai-based startup adds to the long list of global cross-stage layoffs in what has been a rough month for tech employees. Over 15,000 tech workers have lost their jobs in the U.S. alone according to reports. Companies such as Klarna, Getir, Gorillas and Bolt (the payments company) have dismissed portions of their workforce while the likes of Snap, Twitter and Instacart have slowed down hiring entirely.It s been a very busy 18 months for SWVL leading up to this news. This March, the company went public via a SPAC merger with U.S. women-led blank check company Queen s Gambit Growth Capital. It listed at $10 per share and targeted a $1.5 billion valuation but has traded between $4 and $8 for the most part. Its current valuation hovers around $500-$600 million.All eyes are on Swvl as it starts trading on a SPAC combinationThe layoffs are coming just a month after SWVL acquired U.K.-based mass transit group Zeelo for $100 million according to sources. It s one of five acquisitions SWVL has made within the past year; others include Germany s door2door, Turkey s Voltlines (for ~$40 million), Spain s Shotl and Argentina s Viapool.SWVL said that though these acquisitions have contributed to its overall growth, it will need to make reductions on roles automated by investments in its engineering and product and support functions teams.\u201cThe planned layoffs will impact teams responsible for functions that have been automated following investment in engineering, product and support functions,\u201d SWVL said in a statement.SWVL said it plans to attain profitability next year. Dismissing hundreds of employees is one way to get there.\u00a0Others include developing its proprietary technology stack and growing its three models \u2014 where it makes $5 million in MRR \u2014 across existing and new markets, it said in a statement.SWVL is present in 13 markets globally: the UAE, Egypt, Kenya, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Pakistan. According to a source, the majority of the layoffs will come from the company s Dubai and Pakistan offices.Whether SWVL will continue its expansion into new markets such as Colombia, Mexico and South Africa, and the U.S. \u2014 announced during its SPAC merger \u2014 is uncertain.\u201cSwvl plans to provide monetary, non-monetary and job placement support to help transition certain of its employees to new roles,\u201d the company said in a statement on how it plans to support affected employees.\u201cAs a result of the portfolio optimization program, Swvl s management currently expects that the company will be cash-flow positive in 2023.\u201dCEO Mostafa Kandil sent out a letter to his employees addressing the layoffs.

        "title": "Why Convoy s Dan Lewis expects digital freight to go mainstream within the year",
        "text": "Dan Lewis, co-founder and CEO of digital freight company Convoy, didn t start his company because he had a deep and abiding passion for trucking. At least, not at first.The executive has a background in strategy and management consulting that progressed into a career in product development for top tech companies like Google and Amazon. But when he was struck by the urge to start a company, he researched the money-attracting industries of the world, and then, using AngelList, saw how many companies were trying to disrupt those industries.His search yielded thousands of companies that were working on industries ranging from telecommunications and fashion to video games and food. Billions of dollars were going into trucking each year but fewer than 30 startups showed an interest in the field.\u201cI saw a massive opportunity and few people going after it,\u201d Lewis told TechCrunch.Lewis and Grant Goodale co-founded Convoy in 2015, and since then, have brought on a series of high-profile investors. A couple of years after Convoy was founded, in a pivotal turn of events, the company secured its Series B from YC Combinator s Continuity Fund, a fund that was usually geared toward earlier-stage companies.More recently,\u00a0Convoy secured a $260 million Series E, led by Baillie Gifford and T. Rowe Price, that brought the company s valuation up to $3.8 billion. To date, the company has raised almost $1 billion to scale its platform, which connects the fragmented network of shippers, carriers and brokers across the United States. Speed is a big feature of building a startup, and it s also a big feature of not getting diluted, because you can show immense progress and then raise at a higher valuation based on that.Dan Lewis, co-founder and CEO of ConvoyWe sat down with Lewis to talk about the importance of being customer-obsessed when starting a company, why compensation packages in the early days can help you avoid diluting your company too much in future fundraises, and how to set boundaries on the compromises you ll make as a founder.The following interview, which has been edited for brevity and clarity, is part of an ongoing series that focuses on founders in the transportation sector.TC: YC s investment in your Series B was notable because Convoy at the time was outside the Continuity Fund s range of portfolio companies. What do you think made Convoy stand out?Lewis: The YC culture is a really curious one, so they didn t feel like they needed to stay in a particular lane, especially with the Continuity Fund, which was geared toward early growth-stage companies. When we met, I think the breakthrough was just the unique story. People don t usually realize how fragmented, how large, how offline the trucking industry is. So YC viewed this as a major disruptive play.We were excited to work with them because they re an incubator and accelerator, so their whole system is designed around helping founders succeed. They had so many unique programs that helped us be successful and grow that I had never seen from other investors at the time.You mentioned that a good way to decide on a direction for a startup was to compare industries where there s lots of money against companies that are trying to disrupt those industries. Is that still a good method?I think it is a really good method. It would be interesting to pull a list of industries and find out how much money is spent in those industries, and then see how many companies are going after those industries. AngelList is a great resource to find the newest, most innovative companies that are going after these spaces.Before I ever started the company, I wrote this article in Quora that went viral and was published by Forbes. It was an answer to the question: How to come up with a startup idea. I wrote this really extensive theory, basically a playbook. So when I was going to start my own company, I was like, I should eat my own dog food. I went back and used my own process, and I can now say it s credible because it works.",

        "text": "The cannabis industry is doing very well in the United States: More than 75% of the population lives in a state where access is permitted, and the legal market is expected to generate $33 billion this year.A black market still eats into the industry s bottom line, however, and a patchwork of state regulations artificially constrain the TAM for public and private companies managing grow operations, distribution, transportation, inventory control, testing and point-of-sale software.In California, dispensaries advertise on freeway billboards and budtenders are a frequent sight at weddings, but Anna Heim found that the industry still has a long way to go before it reaches maturity nationwide, largely because federal laws continue to bar cannabis-related business from using traditional financial services.Full TechCrunch+ articles are only available to members.Use discount code TCPLUSROUNDUP to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription.To learn more about the underlying market forces and hurdles facing entrepreneurs and investors in this maverick industry, she spoke to four investors:Jacqueline Bennett, managing partner and co-founder, Highlands Venture PartnersYoni Meyer, partner, Casa Verde CapitalMatt Hawkins, managing partner and co-founder, Entourage Effect CapitalEmily Paxhia, managing director, Poseidon Investment ManagementEmily Paxhia joined Anna and me yesterday for a Twitter Space to discuss some of the survey s topics in greater depth, describing cannabis as \u201ctoday s fastest-growing consumer packaged goods category.\u201dAlthough delivery services are oversaturated at the moment, she said she s actively recruiting professionals who have CPG experience in marketing, product management and other roles for Poseidon s portfolio companies.Thanks very much for reading TechCrunch+ this week!

        "title": "Roofstock founder closes on $90M fund to back early-stage proptech startups",
        "text": "Early-stage proptech startups have a potential new source of capital in 1Sharpe Ventures, which recently closed its $90 million inaugural fund.Roofstock co-founder and chairman Gregor Watson and real estate investor Rob Bloemker started the venture firm in 2021, and had their first close last year. The pair say the fund was \u201coversubscribed.\u201d For the unacquainted, Roofstock is an online marketplace for investing in leased single-family rental homes that in March raised $240 million at a $1.9 billion valuation.\u00a0Oakland, California-based 1Sharpe Ventures was born out of another of the pair s endeavors, 1Sharpe Capital, an institutional asset manager with equity real estate investments and a credit fund.The new firm will invest in 30 to 40 early-stage companies in the real estate technology world, with check sizes ranging from $500,000 to $2 million. Specifically, it is targeting pre-seed to Series A-stage companies. Half of the total amount raised \u2014 $45 million \u2014 will be reserved for follow-on investments, according to Watson.So far, the firm has made five investments, backing startups such as construction tech startups\u00a0Cottage\u00a0and\u00a0FlockHomes, and a Brazilian fintech company still in stealth.\u00a0It is open to investing in North America, Latin America and Europe.As it seeks potential investments, 1Sharpe is focusing on three categories: financial transactions and access to capital; real estate human capital; and data and intelligence. For example, 1Sharpe is interested in creating financial products that make real estate more equitable and that can \u201ccreate opportunities for economic mobility.\u201d\u201cWe believe that purchasing and owning real estate can be much more efficient and that the environments where we live and work should be healthier, more sustainable and more enjoyable,\u201d Watson said.Watson and Bloemker together have founded and built nine real estate finance and technology platforms, including Roofstock, Dwell Finance, Lessen, Azibo and Creative Juice, among others. Combined, they have invested more than $8 billion in real estate and technology platforms and portfolios encompassing construction lending, multifamily investing, single-family rentals and land development.\u00a0That experience, Watson believes, gives 1Sharpe an advantage in that the firm can offer its portfolio companies more than capital.\u00a0\u201cWe sit in a unique seat where we really understand capital markets and real estate. We ve done billions and billions of dollars of real estate transactions, but we ve also built a number of high-growth technology companies so we can understand and translate between those two worlds,\u201d Watson told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd I think that it just gives us a competitive advantage because we can help these companies who have really bright technologists that don t understand capital markets and vice versa.\u201dFor Watson, formally becoming an investor was a logical move after he found himself spending about 60% of his days meeting with founders and other venture investors.\u201cI have a real passion for building businesses and working with entrepreneurs. And so that s where I wanted to spend my time,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cI love helping people go from zero to one. I love seeing ideas come to life.\u201dAnd his vision is a long-term one.\u00a0\u201cI m excited by the fact that we get to spend more time with entrepreneurs, really getting to know them. This is a long-term relationship, right? You re getting married and investing in these businesses,\u201d Watson said. \u201cAnd having a shotgun marriage doesn t always end up with the best outcome.\u201dToday, 1Sharpe Ventures has five employees. Ginny Miller serves as a principal and oversees investment strategy and execution. Feng Wang is head of capital markets at 1Sharpe and former founding team member of LendingHome. He aims to help portfolio companies optimize strategic capital structure. Vice President Kathleen Collins will focus on sourcing and performing due diligence on potential new investments.\u00a0\u00a0In terms of its time frame to invest, 1Sharpe is being \u201cvery patient,\u201d noted Watson.\u201cI learned during the last downturn in 2008 that patience is a virtue\u2026and we want to continue to stay patient because we think we re going to see a lot of great talent leaving some of the larger technology companies and starting their own things,\u201d he said.\u00a0As such, Watson expects the firm will invest the first half of its fund over the next two to three years.\u201cThe best thing about this downturn is it reminds entrepreneurs to focus on burn \u2014 go back to \u2014 \u2018what are the unit economics,  like Business 101, and then go and change the world using technology,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "Kenya s MotiSure rides on micro-payments to drive personal mobility insurance growth",
        "text": "Affordability is one of the biggest impediments for insurance penetration in Kenya. Often, policy holders are required to make one-off payments for long-term covers, and the quoted sums are usually beyond the reach of most people. It is this gap that Kenyan insurtech MotiSure is working to seal.The startup, which targets motorcycle taxi (boda boda) operators, their passengers and users of other forms of public transport (hereafter commuters), is building a business around daily micro-payments for personal accident covers, with some premiums going as low as $0.1.Users can opt-in to the service USSD code and make payments using mobile money. The API-powered platform is using technology to disrupt a market that is largely dominated by traditional insurance companies, many of which are reluctant to abandon lengthy paperwork, and traditional payment modalities for both premiums and claims.\u201cWe are providing safety nets through insurance at affordable prices, and through easy to access channels,\u201d MotiSure, CEO & co-founder Joel Macharia told TechCrunch.The personal accident coverage for motorcycle taxi operators, which requires premiums of $0.1 day ($3 a month) includes medical expenses up to $6,000 annually, and payment for loss of income due to hospitalization following an accident, disability or death. Riders have to make consistent payments for at least seven days to get the benefits.Joel Macharia, co-founder and CEO of MotiSure, which is riding on micro-payments to drive personal mobility insurance growth. Image Credits: MotiSureMotiSure is eyeing a market with more than 1.4 million registered motorcycles as per government date (2018). The number is growing, with 210,103 motorcycles being imported into the country in 2020; with the number of imports growing by 20% in 2020 and 15% last year, motorcycles remain a popular means of transport in Kenya and across Africa.Commuters are also eligible for a personal accident cover for every trip they take, with the premiums they pay being based on duration of the journey. Unlike the riders, the commuters qualify for benefits immediately, and MotiSure is looking at an estimated 1.53 million commuters who use public transport every day.The startup, launched in July last year, has teamed up with a number of public service vehicle companies in Kenya to pilot their product.\u201cOne of the barriers to entry is cost, and that is why we have settled for these micro payments and pay per use to make the cost a bit more negligible such that people don t mind paying,\u201d said Macharia.The Micro Insurance Company (formerly MicroEnsure), which has operations in many emerging markets, is the startup s underwriter.Insurtech, on the heels of a fintech boom, heats up in AfricaMacharia said their approach was informed by studies showing that boda boda riders desired insurance products that went beyond asset coverage. In Kenya, all vehicles including motorcycles are required to at least have a third-party insurance policy (which is what most policyholders get), typically the cheapest option, but which leaves out the owners of the assets exposed in case of accidents. This is despite the fact that motorcycle accidents account for about 20% of road accident injuries in Kenya.\u201cThe existing comprehensive or third-party covers don t cover the rider or pillion passengers. And we found out that because of the nature of their jobs, they (riders) wanted a cover that can take care of eventualities like hospitalization, death or disability. Most of these operators are breadwinners and they wanted their families well taken care of in case things took a turn for the worst. They were also keen on taking care of small bike repairs\u2026 we have sorted this out for them,\u201d said Macharia while adding that taking time to do research and talk with potential customers was important for making the product market-fit.\u201cThe way we did our product is very unique. We went to the customers first to understand their patterns. We sat down with groups of people in different regions across the country and asked them what they wanted in an insurance cover. Then we came up with a list of similar covers they wanted and we noted them down, and engaged them to come up with what was most relevant and the most convenient way to make the payments,\u201d said Macharia.Macharia s interest in the sector began in 2018 when he launched a pay-per-use micro insurance product for motor vehicles \u2014 which was informed by data and patterns he had observed when he operated an automobile repair shop. He wondered why most of his clients who only used their vehicles on weekends were compelled to sign up for yearly policies.The idea, however, failed to take off, because the local partners he had targeted to help roll it out were not as helpful. Not one to take rejection easily, he set out to build the necessary technology and execute the idea as he envisioned, starting with the masses.Macharia said they have nearly 10,000 policyholders, and have a capacity of up to 15,000 at the moment, but will open up to more people as the startup grows, and as they partner with third parties to embed the cover in other services. He has his eyes on other markets too.\u201cThe same problem exists across East Africa, and we are looking at how we can offer this within other regions in Africa, as we scale the business, grow the customer base and enhance our products.\u201dFSD Africa expands insurtech accelerator program to Ghana and NigeriaYC-backed Curacel unveils new API platform that enables tech-led businesses to offer insurance",

To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.\u201cYou can often pick up significant market share in an economic downturn by just staying alive,\u201d top startup accelerator Y Combinator wrote in an internal e-mail to its founders this week. The advice was one of ten bullet points in a memo meant to help companies navigate the economic downturn crushing tech. Other stand-out quotes include \u201cplan for the worst\u201d and \u201cno one can predict how bad the economy will get, but things don t look good.\u201dThe email is a vibe shift from just a few weeks ago, when hundreds of Y Combinator startups \u2014 many of which already raised venture funding \u2014 presented themselves to the public on Demo Day. The startups were the first to receive Y Combinator s new $500,000 standard check and were aggressively focused on international opportunity. Now, YC is saying that \u201cthis slow down will have a disproportionate impact on international companies,\u201d among others.YC advises founders to \u2018plan for the worst  amid market teardownWhile Y Combinator s memo wasn t meant to be public, it isn t the only one publishing a Black Swan Memo in preparation for what s to come. TechCrunch obtained a series of memos that venture capitalist firms sent to portfolio companies about the market downturn. Some were hopeful, some were simple, and others were a vibe check as straightforward as, Can you tell us your ARR and cash-burn in writing? Pretty please?I explored this topic in my most recent TechCrunch+ column, \u201cIt s not business as usual (and investors are admitting it).\u201d Subscribe to Equity for a podcast version of this conversation next week as well! In the rest of this newsletter, we ll address more layoffs at tech companies, ghosts showing up to $44 billion dates, and Swyft startups. As always, you can support me by forwarding this newsletter to a friend or following me on Twitter or my blog.So. Many. Layoffs.May s mad month of layoffs continues. Amanda and I wrote up a third installment of tech layoffs that rippled across all industries and stages. Employees from Section4, Carvana, DataRobot, Mural, Robinhood, On Deck, Thrasio, MainStreet and Netflix have been impacted by the workforce reductions. Some bigger companies are instituting hiring freezes, such as Twitter and Meta, or announcing a shift in strategy, such as Uber.Here s why it s important: At time of publication, employees from Picsart, Netflix, Cars24 and Skillz were impacted by this week s wave of reductions. It tells us who is vulnerable from a business model perspective \u2014 such as subscription-based businesses and marketplaces \u2014 and that companies may start to conduct more than one round of layoffs in the same month (cough, cough, Netflix).How quickly are startup layoffs accelerating?Tech employees face another tough week of cross-stage layoffsCoinbase backtracks on its hiring plans, citing crypto market turmoilImage Credits: wildpixel (opens in a new window) / Getty ImagesA Twitter bot wrote thisOn Equity this week, your favorite podcast trio spoke about unicorn vibes, property ownership tech plays and, as you can tell by the headline, the latest in the Elon Musk Twitter story. At this point, we re deciding if it s even worth trying to keep track of the timeline.Here s why it s important: Our weekly digest of tech news is a good way to track the big news items that shape this wonky landscape, and stay aware of deals that may have flown under your radar. In this case, we spent the biggest chunk of time deciding why Elon Musk is ghosting the $44 billion date that he made with Twitter. The answer, not so complicatedly, seems because he s more interested in chasing than cuffing.After we recorded our episode, more news about Elon Musk emerged from an investigation by Business Insider. Allegedly, Elon Musk exposed himself to a SpaceX flight attendant and propositioned her for sex. The company paid $250,000 for her silence, Business Insider reports. Musk has since denied the harassment claims. Read the entire story here.Image Credits: Westend61 / Getty ImagesDeal of the weekSwyft Cities!

        "title": "Swyft Cities is the winner of the TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility 2022 pitch-off!",
        "text": "TechCrunch is excited to announce Swyft Cities won the TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility 2022 pitch-off and is fast-tracked into the Battlefield 200 at TechCrunch Disrupt in October. Beyond Aero is runner-up.The Mountain View-based company is committed to improving transportation through the use of autonomous, lightweight, fixed-cable vehicles. The company says that its solution offers a lower cost per mile with fewer carbon emissions than conventional transportation alternatives.  Swyft sees this as a new form of urban mobility that can solve transportation problems in densely developed areas, including corporate campuses, airports, universities and tourism districts.The platform is novel in that the vehicles move on a stationary cable, allowing for new connections that can be added when needed. This adds capacity into an area, allowing higher density and more profitable developments. It also reduces costs on parking and traffic mitigation. In some areas, providing connections within the site can drive high value.Beyond Aero, based out of Paris/Toulouse, France, is building long-range aircraft powered by hydrogen-electric propulsion. The first aircraft is a zero emission private aircraft (6-9 seat), designed for hydrogen propulsion, flying 1,000 miles in range.Why Swyft was the top choiceImage Credits: Swyft CitiesThe judges for the pitch-off \u2014 Yoon Choi (Muirwoods Ventures), Mar Hershenson (Pear VC) and Gabriel Scheer (Elemental Excelerator) on day one; and Sven Strohband (Khosla Ventures), Victoria Beasley (Prelude Ventures) and John Du (GM Ventures) on day two \u2014 largely thought Swyft Cities had a good direction and a very capable team. The judges said Swyft is approaching a growing problem with a novel solution and a competent go-to-market strategy.Swyft Cities was founded in 2019 by some of the Google alums who were behind transportation and real estate programs at Google s campuses. They were tasked with investigating new forms of mobility that could help achieve what the startup now calls \u201cdistrict-scale transportation\u201d in a way that both reduced car usage and created a better campus environment. The team, which included Swyft founder and CEO Jeral Poskey, reviewed ideas like underground tunnels and autonomous shuttles, but found that most infrastructure solutions existing today are built for long distance commutes, not short distance movement in dense environments.\u201cAs you look to densify things, you have a lot of congestion and difficulty moving around, and this applies to a lot of universities, airports and other places within a one to five mile scale,\u201d Poskey told TechCrunch, noting that it s these closed campus environments that Swyft is targeting first. \u201cGiven the growth that we were looking at and all the market opportunities around the world, we took a chance, started a R&D project to see what we could come up with, and what we came up with was Swyft.\u201dSwyft tapped into Google s existing partnership with Holmes Solutions in Christchurch, New Zealand for R&D, and since its founding has come up with a minimum viable product and secured its first customer agreement. The startup is now working with Remarkables Park in Queenstown, a large office, retail and residential space, to develop a network of autonomous gondolas. Swyft is aiming to have the first vehicles up and running by around August 2024, according to Poskey.\u201c[The team at Remarkables Park] have a first small leg that connects a few buildings and a carpark, and the goal is to test it out and prove it,\u201d said Poskey. \u201cThey then have subsequent phases that will see this growing bigger and bigger, eventually expanding beyond their property until it becomes a public transit system that can go on top of or supplement what s currently a difficult public transit environment down there, and really feed people from these dispersed areas on the edge of town into the bus system that can bring people into the core part of town.\u201dThis model is how Swyft sees itself scaling in other environments and cities, as well. By starting small, it s easy to expand, says Poskey, who explained that the Swyft system doesn t have an endpoint like a train or even a traditional gondola system, but rather operates on a network that can grow outward from any node, thus adding additional value. So while those connections might begin in smaller environments, as they grow outwards, they ll be able to connect to other forms of public transit more easily.From a price perspective, these gondolas cost dramatically less than other public transit alternatives, like expanding roads and building more parking, according to Poskey.\u201cWe hit the price point and the value proposition to say this is cheaper than building parking and you get a better campus experience out of it,\u201d said Poskey. \u201cYou get a better property that s more valuable, and you spent less money to make that happen.\u201dSwyft s target cost point is $10 million per mile or less for the infrastructure, which Poskey says allows for the private sector to build it themselves rather than wait for government funding.\u201cThat was the real trigger to say this is bigger than just something Google s should develop on its own campuses,\u201d said Poskey. \u201cThis is something that has a huge potential, is highly sustainable and just needs to be spun out to pursue the broader market on its own.\u201dThis story has been updated with more background information about Swyft Cities.",

        "title": "Arrival unveils prototype of dedicated ride-hail vehicle at TC Sessions: Mobility",
        "text": "Arrival, the U.K.-founded commercial electric vehicle company, unveiled the first prototype of its purpose-built electric vehicle for ride-hailing on the TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility stage on Thursday. The company, which is perhaps best known for its potentially revolutionary goal of building multiple automated microfactories to produce vehicles regionally and locally rather than one big production line, is building the vehicles in partnership with Uber in the U.K.Arrival president Avinash Rugoobur, who joined TechCrunch s Kirsten Korosec onstage on Wednesday, also shared that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Breathe, a U.K. car subscription company, to make the its ride-hail cars available to drivers. In addition to selling vehicles through Breathe, Arrival will also sell the vehicle through its own channels, said Rugoobur, noting that the vehicle isn t limited to ride-hail.The partnership with Uber was first announced a year ago, and Arrival revealed the final design of the boxy-yet-sleek electric vehicle, which looks like something between a small van and a hatchback, at the end of 2021, although Rugoobur said the design has changed somewhat since then. Arrival has previously said it hopes to begin production in the third quarter of 2023.\u201cWe ve partnered with Uber, and we have the Uber drivers coming in and giving us feedback on the type of vehicles that they want to use and really going through the aches and pains,\u201d said Rugoobur on Thursday. \u201cRight now what happens is you have to buy a vehicle that s not designed for ride-sharing at all, right? So you buy a regular retail vehicle and then use it as your earner. It s an asset to you as an Uber driver, but it s not really built around, it s not easy to clean, not easy to maintain. The way you think about adding new experiences to that, it s actually quite limited.\u201dRendering of Arrival s ride-hail car. Image Credits:\u00a0ArrivalThe vehicle, which Arrival says has over 200 miles of range, was built with feedback from over a hundred Uber drivers, said Rugoobur, and it shows in the design \u2014 huge windows and a massive windshield optimize visibility for the driver, as does a short front overhang and angled nose. The materials Arrival used on the interior, as well as the shapes of the interior components, are all designed around being easy to clean as quickly as possible, according to Rugoobur.In addition, while there is a touchscreen near the steering wheel that plugs into Uber s back end (or that of any other ride-hail organization), Arrival s design is all about simplifying the \u201csheer amount of digital equipment\u201d that drivers said is \u201cdistracting and confusing \u2026 and wastes a lot of their time,\u201d said Rugoobur.The passenger experience is also taken highly into account here, with space for luggage, plenty of legroom and a high-ceilinged moonroof that provides a feeling of airiness.[gallery ids=\"2322074,2322075,2322070\"]\u201cWhy the shape and size of the vehicle? So the footprint is almost of a Golf but it s got the seating room of a Maybach,\u201d said Rugoobur. \u201cThe reason for that was mobility inside cities where a lot of rides are occurring so having a vehicle that s a little bit smaller footprint with the right amount of space for the driver and the passenger was critical.\u201dRugoobur pointed to the fact that form follows function with the Arrival car. For example, Arrival optimizes for space with design choices like allowing the front passenger seat to fold down and putting all of the components, like the drivetrain, in the center under the fully flat floor of the vehicle.\u201cWe use new composite materials. So we use polypropylene glass fiber instead of metal,\u201d said Rugoobur. \u201cNo metal stamping, no paint shops, 100% recyclable material \u2026 and then we write all the software, so we get all the data and the code even from the components level.\u201dRendering of interior of Arrival s ride-hail car showing steering wheel and touchscreen display for drivers.\u00a0Image Credits: ArrivalBeing able to collect data from the back end of the vehicle is one of Arrival s biggest selling points, says Rugoobur, who noted that all information about every component of the vehicle can go to the driver so they can operate their vehicle better and learn how their driver behavior affects things like battery life and total cost of ownership. The data will also be shared with Uber so the ride-hailing company can better optimize its fleet and, of course, back to Arrival so the company can get insights into the performance of things like its battery management system.Because there s \u201ctwo-way communication\u201d between Arrival and the vehicles, the EV startup can use information about how different components are performing and, if necessary, swap in and out damaged hardware or simply upgrade it to keep up with the innovations of tomorrow.\u201cFor the drivers, that reduces the total cost of ownership\u00a0but also improves the residual value at end of life because you re refreshing the vehicle,\u201d said Rugoobur.\u00a0\u201cIt s very hard for the traditional players to custom build a vehicle like this, whereas for us, because we ve essentially created this toolkit of technologies and our factory can produce at different volumes, when typically you would have to produce to 300,000 just for it to make sense from a business perspective, we can do it at a totally different scale and then scale it up as we need,\u201d added the executive.Arrival s ride-hail van will be priced somewhere between an internal combustion engine and a competitive electric vehicle, according to Rugoobur. When reminded that most EVs are branded as luxury vehicles and have a steep upfront price, Rugoobur said the target is to make the car \u201caffordable, affordable, not affordable through [total cost of ownership].\u201dFor comparison, General Motors and Honda recently partnered to build an affordable EV, which Honda has said would go for around $30,000.Earlier this month, Arrival said its planned electric Bus model has achieved certification in the European Union and is conducting closed course trials, with customer models expected to be produced by the second half of this year. The startup also said its Van model is almost through its own certification process and expected to enter production in Q3 of this year.Arrival expects to produce 400 to 600 Vans plus low-volume production of Buses in the second half of 2022, according to the company s Q1 2022 earnings report. The report also notes that Arrival has collected a total of 143,000 non-binding letters of intent and orders for its vehicles as of May, including the commitment from UPS to buy up to 10,000 vehicles from the startup in the U.S. and Europe.Arrival s Denis Sverdlov on the new era of car manufacturingTC Sessions: Mobility 2022",

        "title": "Top three takeaways from Nuro s session at TC Sessions: Mobility",
        "text": "Jiajun Zhu, co-founder and CEO of autonomous robot company Nuro, joined TechCrunch onstage during TC Sessions: Mobility on Wednesday to discuss how the startup aims to revolutionize commercial autonomous delivery.The company is most well-known for its cute self-driving delivery vehicles, which operate on roads, not sidewalks, and are purpose-built to carry pizzas and packages rather than people. Nuro recently unveiled its third generation electric delivery robot, the Nuro, which it s building at a new $40 million manufacturing facility and closed-course test track in southern Nevada.Nuro, which has raised more than $2.13 billion since its founding in 2016, has locked down a range of commercial partners, like Domino s, Kroger, FedEx and 7 Eleven, and is operating and testing in multiple states.TechCrunch managing editor Matt Burns sat down with Zhu to talk about Nuro s path to commercialization, the opportunities and challenges of AV delivery and where the industry, and Nuro, is headed.Here are three key takeaways from their discussion.Zhu hints that LA might be Nuro s next marketNuro is currently operating and testing in California, Arizona and Texas, with a focus on Houston and the San Francisco Bay Area as the company s initial markets, according to Zhu. When asked which markets the startup is targeting next, Zhu said Nuro might make an announcement about that soon, but something tells us Los Angeles might be the nearest target.\u201cWe recently announced that we are also doing data collection and mapping in LA,\u201d said Zhu on Wednesday. \u201cOur focus right now is just trying to make the service really, really good and make our customer happy and super excited in our existing markets.\u201dNuro announced that it had begun mapping in LA in April, saying in a Medium post that the company would soon begin autonomous vehicle testing in the region using its fleet of Toyota Prius vehicles.\u201cOver the next few months, Angelenos can expect to see Nuro s vehicles on public roads, and later this year, we ll begin testing autonomous driving in specific neighborhoods throughout LA County,\u201d the company said in the post. \u201cWhile we are not fully deployed in LA, the Nuro vehicles residents may see are laying the foundation for our autonomous delivery service.\u201dDon t get attached to the idea of Nuro as a delivery company\u201cNuro is really a robotics company,\u201d said Zhu. \u201cWe don t see Nuro as a delivery company or a self-driving car company. Our mission is to better everyday lives through robotics.\u201dWhen Dave Ferguson, Nuro s president and co-founder, and Zhu founded Nuro, it was with the conviction that within 20 years, robots will be everywhere, helping people to have a better life. Choosing to focus on delivery was less about the feeling that delivery was the most important avenue, and more that it would simply be one of the first.\u201cWe looked at all these different verticals and asked ourselves, which one is going to have the biggest impact on a lot of people?\u201d said Zhu. \u201cWe have this unique expertise and competence that we can build something that is better than other companies, potentially. Which product can have that impact in a reasonable timeline, not 10 years from now, but something that we can see and a use for in a reasonable timeline?\u201dFor the time being, the market opportunity for transporting goods across various retail verticals allows for Nuro to be an actual business, not just a science experiment. Zhu said Americans take up to 100 billion trips every year for shopping and running errands. Automating that can potentially be a huge time saver for a lot of people. But Nuro hasn t ruled out other ways to save people time \u2014 Zhu said he s particularly interested in home robots.\u201cI really want a robot that can fold my laundry in the future,\u201d he said.The benefits of partnering with auto OEMs on robotsNuro has partnered with BYD North America on its newest generation delivery robot, and Zhu said it s designed for manufacturing.\u201cIt is, we believe, the first vehicle that is automotive quality, that will be mass manufactured,\u201d said Zhu. \u201cIt has much bigger cargo space based on all the feedback and input that we learned [from previous iterations].\u201dAs Nuro works on getting its self-driving tech up to speed, being able to manufacture vehicles with the backing of a major automaker is critical to scaling and becoming profitable.Another benefit is being able to include automotive-grade speed and safety features. The Nuro can drive up to 45 miles per hour, which gives it plenty of geographic coverage but eliminates the need to drive on the freeway. It also has safety features like an airbag in the front of the vehicle, rather than on the inside, so it can protect vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists. The Nuro also has active heating and cooling so it can deliver a hot pizza and a cold beer at the same time, said Zhu.TC Sessions: Mobility 2022",

        "text": "ChargeLab, a Toronto-based startup that builds software to operate and optimize electric vehicle charging equipment for fleets and commercial customers, has raised a $15 million Series A round. The round was led by King River Capital and notably includes participation from strategic investor ABB E-Mobility, a spinoff of technology company ABB that focuses on electric mobility and building charging stations.As part of ChargeLab s commercial agreement with ABB, the two companies will launch a bundled hardware and software solution for fleets, multifamily buildings and other commercial EV charging use cases, according to Zak Lefevre, founder and CEO of ChargeLab. While the partnership with ABB will certainly give ChargeLab the resources it needs to build out and scale its enterprise software, Lefevre noted that ABB s interest in ChargeLab stems from the company s need for a better out-of-the-box software in North America.\u201cThe reality is that ABB has a device with the capability to connect to the internet, but they haven t built those back-end services for connecting it, managing it, doing billing and payments, scheduling and power management and all those things,\u201d Lefevre told TechCrunch. \u201cSo we are very much in that transition phase where everybody s making their devices ready to connect to the cloud, but these big hardware companies haven t necessarily thought through what all the second order consequences are and all the other systems that chargers are going to need to plug out to, whether it s a parking management system or demand response system to the grid.\u201dChargeLab s core product is its cloud-based charging station management system, which provides apps for EV drivers, dashboards for fleet managers and open APIs for third-party system integration. The hardware-agnostic software, which runs on the edge and in the cloud, also includes capabilities like automated monitoring of chargers, management of pricing and access rules, payment processing and electrical load balancing, according to the company.The startup s latest funding round, which also included existing investors like Construct Capital, Root Ventures, Highline Beta, Third Sphere and Maple VC, will help the company go from its seed stage-level solution of connecting chargers and controlling them in the cloud to more advanced milestones.\u00a0\u201cIs that going to be SOC 2 compliant? Is it going to be scalable across hundreds of thousands of devices?\u201d Lefevre said. \u201cABB is selling to the biggest fleets and the biggest enterprises in the world. Are we going to be able to bundle with ABB and meet those needs?\u201d(SOC 2 is a voluntary compliance standard developed by the American Institute of CPAs, which specifies how organizations should manage customer data.)ChargeLab s software is embedded onto chargers, which helps ensure those chargers are not only secure but also efficient and working flawlessly on the back end, co-founder and chief technology officer Ehsan Mokhtari told TechCrunch.\u201cAnd that ties into the security side of things. EV chargers will be a target of cybersecurity attacks as they are connected, so we are very active and in front of it,\u201d said Mokhtari. \u201cWe already formed the InfoSec team within the ChargeLab company, as well as advanced techniques to handle offline behavior and self healing for these chargers. So that is really top of mind for us to build products and take them to market with our partners.\u201dAside from ABB, ChargeLab works with EV charger manufacturers like Phihong, United Chargers, Siemens and Tritium. The startup s tech is also white-labeled by charging networks like Girardin Energy, TurnOnGreen and EVStart. Lefevre says ChargeLab s software is currently inside thousands of devices in North America, but has yet to surpass the 10,000 charger mark. That said, Lefevre says the EV charging industry is growing exponentially, which means the market opportunity is massive.ABB and AWS team up to create an EV fleet management platform",

        "text": "Joby Aviation, a California-based company developing electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOL) for commercial passenger service, announced the acquisition of Avionyx, an aerospace software engineering firm, on the TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility stage on Wednesday.The companies did not disclose the terms of the deal, but Joby said that Avionyx will become a wholly-owned subsidiary with resources to expand its team. It also likely means that this was a combination equity and cash deal.Joby s piloted five-seat eVTOL aircraft can carry four passengers at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour, with a maximum range of 150 miles on a single charge, the company said.Taking on Avionyx, a company with over 30 years in the aerospace environment that has been working with Joby since last year, allows Joby to do what many companies are trying to do: become vertically integrated.\u201cWe believe [being vertically integrated is] the fastest way to get to market because we don t have to worry as much about some of the supply chain issues. We can think about, what are the regulations for certifying the pilots, how do you actually build the simulators?\u201d said Bonny Simi, head of air operations and people at Joby, onstage on Wednesday. \u201cYou know, when you certify a plane, you then also have to certify a simulator at the same time.\u201dAt the moment, Joby is focusing on vertical integration around aircraft development and certification. The company s first Systems Review and Compliance Review by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was first approved in March, but the Avionyx buy will help support Joby s aircraft type certification program with the agency. Avionyx has worked extensively with the FAA, as well as the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, in the past.Software verification is critical to meeting FAA regulations and standards because it allows engineers to review, analyze and test the software deployed across the aircraft, according to Joby. It also ostensibly helps to avoid vehicle crashes, like the one currently being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board based on a Joby aircraft crash in February.\u00a0By not relying on third parties, Joby also can be more flexible in managing its platform, responding to challenges nimbly and applying learnings more quickly, according to the company.\u00a0Gary Gysin, CEO of Wisk Aero, another eVTOL company that s focusing on autonomous air operations, disagreed with Simi onstage at TC Sessions: Mobility about the benefits of vertical integration, saying that not owning all of the components will actually give Wisk a faster path to market, so it looks like the game is afoot. However, because Wisk isn t aiming for piloted rides, Gysin did concede that Joby s aircraft will likely hit the skies before Wisk s. Joby is targeting aerial ridesharing service in 2024.Avionyx s experience in the sector will be able to help Joby advance operations at its Vehicle Software Integration Lab in Marina, California, where Joby uses flight and hardware simulators to rapidly conduct thousands of pre-programmed tests to validate and verify the performance of its different aircraft software systems. The company said a similar facility will be set up in San Jose, Costa Rica, where Avionyx hails from, to accelerate those software verification efforts.In addition to supporting\u00a0Joby s FAA certification program, Avionyx, an AS-9100D-certified supplier, will continue its work in support of the broader aviation community.Joby Aviation partners with Japanese airline to launch air taxi service",

The new lane challenges Aurora s trucks to a much longer journey of about 600 miles, on which they will operate on a weekly basis, according to the company.Texas has become a battleground for autonomous freight companies looking to commercialize, with competitors Waymo Via, Kodiak Robotics and TuSimple all piloting their vehicles on many of the same highways.Aurora has been hauling freight between its new terminals in Fort Worth and El Paso since March, the company said. Shipments carried out on its first commercial lane between Dallas and Houston have all been delivered on time 100% of the time, according to Aurora, which noted that it has provided thousands of FedEx customers with autonomously transported packages.Aurora s trucks, which are based on the new Peterbilt 579, are capable of operating during various weather conditions and all hours of the day and night.

        "text": "Ben Bear, the CEO of shared micromobility operator Spin, is stepping down from his role just a couple of months after the company was purchased by Tier Mobility, another shared operator with a large European presence.In Bear s place will be Philip Reinckens, a Tier veteran who, as of June 6, will be responsible for leading the new direction of Spin, including accelerating the integration with its new parent company.\u201cIt s been a whirlwind since I took over last year,\u201d Bear told TechCrunch. \u201cReally from the first day that I took over, the top objective that I got from Ford was to find a partner, and I feel like we ve landed the plane on that and it s a perfect time to step aside and accelerate us becoming one company while keeping the DNA that has made Spin the top choice of cities.\u201dWhen Tier acquired Spin from Ford in March, it marked the German company s entrance into\u00a0the North American market.Reinckens, who is relocating with his family from Munich to San Francisco, has held several roles at Tier in Germany, including most recently the VP of business transformation. Prior to that role, Reinckens served as general manager of a European region comprising six countries.Before joining the micromobility landscape, Reinckens worked as a strategy consultant in the automotive industry for companies like Volkswagen and Faurecia, a Tier One supplier.We sat down with the new CEO to talk about Tier s plans for Spin s future growth, and why he s the person to lead that transition.This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.TC: You come from an automotive background. What lessons have you taken from that world and applied to shared micromobility?\u00a0Philip Reinckens:\u00a0After working for Volkswagen and Faurecia, I switched sides to external consulting, but still focused on the automotive and mobility industry. That was back in 2013. We were supporting OEMs and suppliers with all the hot topics of the day around electrification, autonomous mobility, connectivity and all that,\u00a0I was really drawn into that.Normally with consultants, either you stay until you become a partner or you look for a good opportunity to go out into the field and do something on your own. For me that came in 2019 when the German market opened to micromobility. I knew that the scooter segment was really going through the roof in North America with a lot of heavy VC funding, so I was super curious about doing consulting for a startup.So what I take out of automotive, but especially my background as a consultant, is the willingness to work and deliver fast and focus on what s important. I think being quick in execution and also doing long hours is something you learn in consulting, and when we launched Tier in the German market, I was working way more than I used to because suddenly we had eight cities to manage from day one.\u00a0I really like the independence and the speed of a startup.Where do you see the biggest opportunities for change and growth with Spin?Spin already excels at a lot today. They were the first to do sidewalk riding detection, everything they ve done around winning university campuses, the hubs and charging systems\u2026those are really excellent USPs. So it s worth focusing on and strengthening those.I want to focus on the consumer experience, having the right features but also providing reliable mobility, which means having the right scooter at the right point in time at the right spot. Tier has a lot of learnings there that we can bring over.We want to go all in on swappable batteries. It changes the way operations need to be run because simply you cannot put scooters every morning in the same place where you know that the conversion is great, but you have to find ways to reallocate and rebalance the scooters in the most efficient manner. And so my strategy for the next 12 months is to really make sure that this integration is a success, that we are tapping into the synergies and efficiencies as a joint company and build on what Spin is already great at, while also finding some some levers into the European market. We are already in talks over some great initiatives and partnerships to potentially look into further expansion.You mentioned Spin s sidewalk riding tech, which comes from Drover AI. Tier also recently purchased Fantasmo, bringing its camera positioning technology in-house. Given Bird and Lime s recent announcement about working with Google s ARCore tech, which is similar to Fantasmo s, is Tier thinking of bringing those capabilities to the U.S., either alongside Drover s or instead of it?Everybody at the moment is looking into these kinds of technologies. Parking and rider behavior is the number one criteria for winning cities. But if you look and compare the different competitors, like Luna, Fantasmo and Drover, they seem to be similar, but in terms of capabilities, they re very different. One is advanced in this direction. The other one is advanced in that direction.Fantasmo s biggest asset is around parking, and Drover is especially strong on sidewalk detection. At the moment we re super happy to be working with both of them and everyone has the right tech for different use cases. In the U.S. it s different than in Germany.So parking isn t an issue in the U.S.?Not as much compared to Germany because here there are lots of racks and physical locks which can be used. There s also a lot more free floating and free parking in Germany and France and the U.K. where Fantasmo s tech makes more sense.How do you envision Tier in Europe working with Spin in North America?It s clear that you need to focus one brand on one continent. But between the companies and the different USPs and strengths and capabilities, clearly the entire acquisition is there to leverage the strength and to make both companies better.Consumers in North America at the moment have a very strong relationship with Spin, and Tier is a completely unknown brand. At the moment, switching that would risk losing customers.Tier has been on a buying spree lately, both vertically and horizontally, in order to expand into new markets. Is Tier considering any more acquisitions in North America?\u00a0At the moment, it s unclear to say. As you can imagine with nextbike, Spin and Fantasmo, we have a tough integration to do. Quality goes first. Quantity second.Spin has a lot going for it in terms of tech and relationships with cities, but some have said being backed by Ford resulted in a lot of cash burn. And obviously, the unit economics for micromobility aren t quite there yet. So is there anywhere in particular where you see room for improvement in terms of decreasing overhead or increasing revenue?Having worked for big car companies before, I really know how corporations look internally and how they re sometimes comfortable in terms of spending. I believe this is the biggest difference between Spin and Tier. Tier has 100% startup DNA where we we really look out for our cash burn. I think that s also what brought us into the position to be able to compete with Bird and Lime and others, that we were the most capital-efficient companies. I mean, otherwise we would not have been backed by SoftBank and Goldman.It s in our DNA to be cost-conscious, and to tie ecological sustainability to financial sustainability. We can only provide an alternative mobility solution if the unit economics behind it are sustainable, and that means not losing money on a per-ride basis. This is one of the big strengths we have and where we can certainly help Spin get better going forward.Can you give me an example of how Tier s been good at cost saving?Well, we talked about swappable batteries, and we were the first player to go all in on that technology, which allowed us to lower variable costs significantly. When I look back at the days of the first Corona wave in Europe, we saw that due to our cost advantages, which we got through swappable batteries and in-housing all our operations, we were able to keep our scooter fleet on the streets even during lockdown when all the other competitors in Germany had to pull theirs.We were able to provide basic mobility even though movements on the streets were significantly lowered, but we caught that little bit of demand. And people were scared then of using public transport so a lot of customers then saw that micromobility is a good alternative.Zooming out to the industry at large, your biggest competitors in the U.S. are Lime and Bird, and in Europe, possibly Bolt and Voi. Is there anything you think your competitors are doing right? Or alternatively, doing wrong?\u00a0Let me start with Bolt. They have recently raised a massive round. But you really have to also acknowledge that their business is just different. They re using micromobility as an acquisition tool for their ride-hailing and food delivery/quick e-commerce business. So it s not entirely comparable.When I look at Bird, for instance, I am surprised to see that they have not invested into swappable batteries. I understand the reasons from their perspective. But as the whole industry has moved toward swappable batteries, I m just surprised that they re the only ones, out of the big ones, to still stick with that. Also, with their platform model, they haven t focused on the city. And I think right now we re in a phase where we see that focusing on the city is crucial.Bird is one of the only public shared micromobility companies. Does Tier have any plans to go public soon?Right now? Look at Bird s stock. I think the elephant in the room is that Bird didn t choose the right timing. That s just bad luck. Maybe also the vehicle itself as a SPAC \u2014 I m not a big fan of SPACs, to be quite honest. But I mean, it s just sad that as a representative of an entire segment, that they are getting bashed so heavily. I think the market is overreacting on Bird, and it doesn t do the industry any good.",

        "text": "Generation Investment Management, a sustainability-focused public and private equity firm co-founded by Al Gore, is upping its bet on growth-stage companies via a new $1.7 billion fund.With $36 billion in total assets under management, Generation puts the majority of its money behind publicly traded companies. But the new investment vehicle \u2014 dubbed Sustainable Solutions Fund IV \u2014 is still nothing to sneeze at, representing a 70% jump from the size of the firm s previous growth fund.This time around, Generation aims to plow between $50 million and $150 million into 15 to 18 \u201chigh-growth\u201d businesses that advance environmental and social goals, such as mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, tackling inequality in finance and making healthcare more accessible. Ideally, Generation s investment targets are \u201cdriving the transition to the sustainable future\u201d while pulling in somewhere between $30 million and $300 million in annual revenue, partner and growth equity head Lila Preston said in a call with TechCrunch.\u201cFrom the very beginning Generation put sustainability research at the core of its investment process, because we thought it helped us find the very best businesses and management teams that we could back over the long term,\u201d said Preston. That research, which goes into topics like electrifying transportation, remote work and circular economies, offers some explanation as to why Generation s portfolio includes both project management tool Asana as well as more obviously sustainability-minded companies. The latter camp includes the likes of Pivot Bio, which aims to tackle farming s nitrogen pollution problem.\u201cYou can t have a healthy life on a sick planet,\u201d and \u201cyou certainly can t have a net-zero future without inclusion,\u201d added Preston.\u00a0London and San Francisco-based Generation thoroughly reports its sustainability research each year, but the company is not as forthcoming about its investors. Declining to name specific limited partners, the firm said they are largely based in North America and Europe, and include pension funds, investment banks and rich people.",

        "title": "5 construction tech investors analyze 2022 trends and opportunities",
        "text": "Often, industries that have great potential to be disrupted are also the most resistant to adopting bleeding-edge technology.\u00a0While legacy sectors like transportation and energy have embraced new tech, innovation in the construction industry has been slow to take hold.Even though many large construction firms manage internal R&D units, more than a third of employees say they re reluctant to adopt new technology.\u00a0\u201cThis is a structural problem of the industry, as there are fairly low margins and everything is project-based,\u201d said Heinrich Gr\u00f6ller, a partner at Speedinvest. \u201cIt is difficult to find a project manager who is willing to take the risk to implement bleeding-edge tech on their project.\u201dAll the investors we spoke to agreed that finding workers is one of the biggest challenges in the industry, but the pinch isn t limited to job sites. Due to the Great Resignation and restrictions to immigration laws, \u201cthis labor shortage affects both blue-collar and white-collar labor,\u201d said Sungjoon Cho, partner at D20 Capital. \u201cWe recently heard of a major construction company s regional office that lost around 10% of their white collar workers last year alone to employees leaving the construction industry altogether!\u201dTechCrunch is widening the lens, looking for more, and more diverse investors to include in our surveys, where we poll top professionals about problems and challenges in their industry.If you re an investor and would like to participate in future surveys, fill out this form.Even so, investors are backing startups bringing robotics, data management, automation and augmented reality into the construction process. With the industry representing about 6.3% of the U.S. GDP, the market opportunity is huge, especially as spending climbs \u2014 the U.S. construction industry saw spending reach an all-time high of $1.57 trillion last year, according to a recent Deloitte study.The U.S. government wants to help boost innovation in this crucial sector, too. Its recently enacted $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes only $100 million for digital construction technologies, but if new tech is used in public infrastructure projects, it could prove a boon for the industry.To better understand the market forces driving this sector and learn about the opportunities they re seeking, we spoke to five active investors:Nikitas Koutoupes, managing director, Insight PartnersHeinrich Gr\u00f6ller, partner, SpeedinvestMomei Qu, managing director, PSP GrowthSuzanne Fletcher, venture partner, Prime Movers LabSungjoon Cho, general partner, D20 CapitalNikitas Koutoupes, managing director, Insight PartnersWhat s the most exciting development in construction tech right now? Where are you seeing more interest from investors and founders \u2014 residential or commercial?We are excited about how the industry is shifting its mindset from simply digitizing workflows to transforming how projects get built using insights, automation and AI. Every important builder is exploring how these new technologies will drive productivity on the job site.At this point, we re seeing more interest in commercial projects. In large commercial projects, there are so many places where delays and other issues can pop up, so new technology providers can drive serious ROI by improving workflows.Given the large scope and budgets of these projects, being more efficient can save a lot of money, and owners and general contractors (GCs) are willing to pay for innovative technology. What excites us about the timing now is, it seems GCs and owners are willing to adopt and pay like they haven t before.Where are you looking for opportunities in construction tech in Q3 2022? We re interested in investing across the entire construction lifecycle \u2014 from pre-construction tools like scheduling and bidding, to job site tools, including progress tracking and data and analytics to drive efficiency.Given the flexibility of Insight s platform, we re able to partner across all stages \u2014 from seed to late-stage growth \u2014 so are looking to partner with interesting startups addressing the industry s challenges at any stage in their growth journey. \u201cIn large commercial projects, there are so many places where delays and other issues can pop up, so new technology providers can drive serious ROI by improving workflows.\u201dNikitas Koutoupes, MD, Insight PartnersDespite the current market conditions, we intend to stay quite active in Q3. We don t think the long-term outlook on construction tech has changed and have several high-priority segments that we re eager to make investments in.For example, we haven t yet partnered with any companies in robotics, procurement and finance, and labor management, but we re seeing a lot of interesting early players emerge. We plan to stay true to our strategy and will continue to invest across a very wide range of stages.How has this space changed since the pandemic began? How mature is the sector; are these still early days?We ve seen COVID as a tailwind for the construction tech industry. Due to the pandemic, many contech workers were unable to freely visit their job sites and realized they had less visibility than they d like into what was happening onsite. For an industry that has historically been averse to tech, feeling this pain point was a real catalyst for adoption.Across segments, we ve seen field workers become more open to exploring digital platforms and to the ROI they can deliver to projects.We think construction tech is still in its early innings. In the last few years, Procore and Autodesk have shown that the industry is ready to adopt software and capable of building big public tech outcomes, but there are still so many workflows left to be addressed. It s an exciting time to be investing in construction tech.A lot of this tech is focused on job sites, but given the need for data collection and analysis, what advances are you seeing in back-end technologies? Is there a killer app?One of our portfolio companies, Versatile, is a great example of using job site data collection to drive actionable insights for GCs. Versatile is at its core a data science company, not just a data collection tool. Data collection from the perspective of the crane is Versatile s wedge into getting structured data at a job site.From there, they re able to generate powerful insights into efficiency. So while there is a strong need for data collection, the real winners will be the companies that have a strong back end to provide actionable insights from all this data.Which areas of the construction industry can tech help improve right now? Where do you see the biggest potential breakthroughs in the next five to 10 years?We see a lot of companies in the data collection and analysis space. The market is very fragmented today, but we re very excited about the potential of all of these systems to talk to each other and for one comprehensive suite of tools that can ingest data from all angles.As these platforms consolidate in the next five to 10 years, we re excited to see GCs using one single source of truth for their projects, which would greatly help track progress, efficiency insights, safety measures and more.We re also excited about the potential impact of cutting-edge robotics. Take layout, for example. Today, many project sites sketch out their layout using chalk and string \u2014 even for infrastructure projects that can span miles. Next-gen robotics companies are building robots to automatically print out precise models on the project floor. They re meaningfully more accurate than the human-drawn layouts and are much faster.This is just one example, but it s illustrative of the way that new technology will dramatically change the way we build for the better.The construction industry has been fairly reluctant when it comes to adopting bleeding-edge tech. Is this a marketing problem or a product-market fit problem?We think a big part of why the industry is thought of as reluctant to adopt technology is because some construction tech tools have not been designed to integrate into existing construction workflows. Construction teams are first and foremost focused on project execution, and if a new tool doesn t immediately help them execute and drive ROI, they have little bandwidth to explore it.The other challenge is that most solutions have to be incorporated into the broader construction process. You can t have half the team using one system and the rest using something else. The customer has to see how the change management will be seamless.How easily tools integrate into existing construction workflows, and how quickly they can drive quantifiable ROI on a project (whether through time savings or cost savings) are two of the key things we look for in contech startups.The $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act the U.S. passed this year is expected to be a shot in the arm for construction tech. How large a role do you think governments will play in promoting construction tech via procurement, incentives, grants, subsidies, etc.?We are hopeful that more public funding will come with mandates to use software to reduce project risk and improve job site safety. There is a direct corollary with Obamacare driving adoption on medical records.That said, we believe buy-in on the field is essential, even if new tools are being procured by the office. It is difficult to push solutions on people, whether that s a GC pushing it onto subs, or owners and government pushing it onto GCs \u2014 you must be able to show real value.Are lower labor costs making construction-related automation a harder sell in some parts of the world? Conversely, in areas like the U.S., where there have been long-term labor shortages, where do you see this tech lowering costs and speeding up project timelines?A lot of the technology is about helping keep labor coordinated, productive and on track more than its about replacing labor shortages. Even in markets with low cost of labor, the costs of mistakes, rework and delays are all material enough that contractors care about using technology to build correctly the first time.That said, labor shortages can be a compelling reason for customers to procure new solutions, and we see a lot of new tech companies pitch the labor shortages as a positive tailwind.How do you advise portfolio companies to approach potential clients who don t see an urgent need to modernize?The construction industry is skeptical of outsiders coming in to tell them they need to change, but they also understand they have to change to keep up with competition.We advise our companies to make sure they are showing up as true partners to the industry and emphasize how their solutions can bring reliable and demonstrable ROI. A lot of our companies find success through deep partnerships with their early pilot customers \u2014 they ll work closely with a large GC to design a solution that directly meets the needs of the customer, and then once proven, can work toward broader rollouts (both within their pilot customers  projects and outside).We ve seen this \u201cland and expand\u201d approach across a number of portfolio companies and prospective companies.When investing in a construction tech startup, what green flags do you look out for? Are you open to backing founders who don t have experience in the industry?",

        "title": "QuestBook raises $8.3 million to help web3 developers secure funds",
        "text": "Blockchain and other web3 projects are racing to reach developers, hosting hackathons, bandying out grants and offering other perks to lure those who can build. But they currently don t have the bandwidth to review the voluminous number of applications they receive, which pushes away some of the same builders who can bring immense value to those projects.QuestBook, a startup that is attempting to solve that and more, said today it has raised $8.3 million in its Series A funding as it looks to scale its efforts.The financing round was led by Lemniscap and saw participation from scores of investors, including Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research, Dragonfly, Hashed, Polygon, Balaji Srinivasan, Raj Gokal of Solana, Arjun Sethi of Tribe Capital and Maneesh Sharma of GitHub.QuestBook operates an eponymous platform that allows firms to give grants to developers and invest in them in an efficient and more transparent way. It also screens projects using a number of factors such as a developer s on-chain and GitHub history to shoulder much of the burden from various blockchain and web3 firms.The startup, founded in May 2021, originally set out to help builders earn in crypto. But it soon realized, explained Madhavan Malolan, one of its co-founders, that there weren t many developers who knew how to code in Solidity and Rust, the programming languages underpinning Ethereum and Solana blockchains, respectively.There s a large whitespace in the developer ecosystem today. Just as retail investors  appetite slows down when crypto enters the bear cycle, many developers also start to explore other, more familiar opportunities.But more importantly, there aren t too many developers coding for web3 in the first place, a problem that can be solved with long-term incentives. Even as more than 34,000 new developers committed code for a web3 project in 2021, it s still a tiny fraction of the global software engineers base, according to a recent report by Electric Capital, a venture firm that invests in web3 startups.To kick things off, QuestBook began teaching developers how to code in these languages at no charge and also published over 100 tutorials for anyone to get started. The program quickly took off, said Malolan, and amassed over 18,000 developers. Since attracting a large enough base, QuestBook has been exploring ways to help developers secure funds to build their projects.\u201cThat s something we always kind of vibe with,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cFor example, I have never bought any crypto in my life. All the crypto that I have, I earned them by contributing to open source projects.\u201d\u201cOne of the things we saw during the late December break was that people were not looking at crypto as a full-time job. They were looking at it as a side-job. We wondered how we could give these people an opportunity to start earning on the side so that they can find financial mobility and then double down,\u201d he said.Nearly every blockchain, their foundations, or firms building atop of these projects offer grants. They typically fund these projects through their own tokens, thereby increasing the value of their own digital assets if more developers build something viable on their platforms.But as mutually beneficial as this transaction appears, it is confusing and overwhelming at times to identify the themes the variety of firms wish to back and the rate at which they are deploying the funds. Often it may take a developer months to just hear from the protocol, for instance.And these firms need additional assistance in credential-gating the applications to remove potential bad players. Uniswap, a decentralized network on Ethereum credited for the emergence of the DeFi ecosystem on the mothership, learned this lesson the hard way.The firm last year offered a no-strings-attached $20 million grant to developers, which quickly saw over 50% of the capital being swapped for a stablecoin.QuestBook today works with Polygon, Aave, Near and Harmony, and has helped them provide developers over $1.5 million in grant money. The startup, which currently doesn t monetize its software, plans to increase this grants disbursement to $30 million to $50 million over the next two quarters, it said.It has much larger ambitions beyond helping developers secure grants, he said.QuestBook s tool is already helping firms create small funds across the globe so that local talent can find and invest in new projects. The investments are all transparent and if the developers think the individual running the show isn t doing a good job, they can vote to have the person replaced.\u201cIt s minimal grants DAO with maximum community participation. I know we need to come up with a better name,\u201d Malolan laughed. \u201cThe idea is that let us say you re running a network or a protocol, and you re able to see some innovation happening in a space or a region that you don t have the expertise or bandwidth to evaluate, you delegate capital to others.\u201dQuestBook is also working to broaden the ways developers can find work opportunities.\u201cRight now, we are solving the capital allocation problem,\u201d said Malolan. \u201cWhat we are aiming for is to bring permissionless work to crypto. An Uber driver can tap a button and get the job and start earning. The same infrastructure is not available for developers. Of course to solve this, you will need strong credentialing, strong workflows, and capital. We are beginning to tackle the workflows.\u201dMalolan hesitated to talk much about it, saying the efforts are in early stage, but shared that QuestBook has built a wallet of its own that does gasless transactions (meaning users won t be required to pay transaction fees to do transactions.)\u201cWallets we all use today are designed for DeFi. Since in our case, we are not transacting money, but just information, it made sense for us to build our own gasless wallet where it doesn t cost people anything to save information. For the most part, developers will not even know, nor should they, that there s a wallet in play,\u201d he said.Subscribe to TechCrunch s crypto newsletter \u201cChain Reaction\u201d for news, funding updates and hot takes on the wild world of web3 \u2014 and take a listen to our companion podcast!",

        "text": "Digital automotive commerce company Autochek has acquired Morocco s KIFAL Auto for an undisclosed amount, marking the entry of the vehicle marketplace into North Africa.The deal comes barely a year after Autochek bought Cheki Kenya and Cheki Uganda from Ringier One Africa Media. Prior to the September 2021 transaction, Autochek had bought Cheki s subsidiaries in Ghana and Nigeria, and partnered with the CFAO Group to launch the network in Ivory Coast. After KIFAL Auto s acquisition, Autochek is now present in six countries across East, West and North Africa.Like Autochek, KIFAL Auto links car buyers and sellers, and also, through partnerships, offers several other services including financing and insurance.\u201cFrom my first interaction with Nizar and his team at KIFAL Auto, I was so impressed by their passion for delivering effective solutions and their commitment to innovation. They have built an excellent platform and we are thrilled to have them onboard at Autochek to support the work we are doing to improve the automotive finance value proposition in Africa. There are so many parallels in our individual stories and I look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship for years to come,\u201d said Autochek co-founder and CEO, Etop Ikpe, in a statement.(L-R) Autochek CEO and co-founder Etop Ikpe and KIFAL Auto founder Nizar Abdallaoui Maane. lmage Credits: AutochekKIFAL, which was founded in 2019 by Nizar Abdalaoui Maane, is among the leading auto marketplaces in Morocco, one of the largest markets for used and new cars in Africa. Following the latest deal, Maane and the KIFAL auto team join Autochek to lead the company s expansion efforts in North Africa.\u201cI have long been an admirer of the work Autochek has done to enable improved experiences across Africa s automotive value chain. There is so much we can learn from each other, and I am looking forward to bringing my experience and expertise to deliver more game-changing innovation in Morocco and beyond.

Morocco is a gateway into North Africa and I am confident that we can unlock new value and drive further transformation across the board,\u201d said Maane.Autochek says it has 1,500 dealers as partners across its markets and has partnerships with more than 70 financing partners including Access Bank, Ecobank, UBA, Bank of Africa and NCBA Bank.Cars listed on the site go through various stages of inspection and are rated according to their status and performance. Ekpe said in a past TechCrunch interview that, \u201cThe assessments and some algorithmic checks on Autochek s system help to give a sense of the status and condition of the car, determining whether it is in a state to be financed \u2026 because they (banks) do not want a situation where they finance a car and the next day, the engine knocks.\u201dAutochek said loans are approved in about 48 hours. The company earns by charging a fee to dealers listing on its platforms, in addition to a loan facilitation commission from banks.Autochek, which in October last year raised $13.1 million in a seed round, is backed by a number of investors including pan-African VC firms TLcom Capital, 4DX Ventures, Golden Palm Investments, Enza Capital, Lateral Capital, ASK Capital and Mobility 54 Investment SAS, the venture capital arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group.TLcom and 4DX drive $13.1M seed round to scale Autochek s platform across Africa",

        "title": "Keelvar raises $24M to automate procurement in the supply chain",
        "text": "Supply chain disruptions caused \u2014 or exacerbated \u2014 by the pandemic continue to affect businesses in a range of industries. For example, 36% of small businesses responding to a U.S. Census Small Business Pulse last year reported delays with domestic suppliers. Each missed shipment or material shortage can be costly. In a 2021 Deloitte survey, more than 40% of chief financial officers indicated that supply chain shortages or delays increased their companies  expenditures by 5% or more.Supply chain technology companies have risen to prominence during the shortages, promising a solution to a problem that looks unlikely to abate anytime soon. One of these vendors is Keelvar, a Cork, Ireland-based supply chain analytics platform that weighs different sourcing scenarios to guide customers to decisions for their supply chains.Keelvar is headed by Alan Holland, who left his position as a lecturer in AI at the University of College Cork to found the startup in 2012.\u201cMy goal was to use my specialist knowledge in optimization, game theory, and mechanism design to commercialize advances in AI for procurement teams,\u201d Holland told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201c[O]ur solutions have helped our customers adapt to ever more volatile conditions, notably in the transportation market, where our [platform has] allowed customers to source efficiently in an adverse environment.\u201dOrganizations that rely on the supply chain, which is practically all of them, engage in a process called procurement. Procurement entails acquiring goods and services from suppliers who typically compete for business by submitting bids that companies evaluate. Suppliers with the most attractive bid are awarded a contract, the terms of which are subject to negotiation.Evaluating procurement bids with Keelvar. Image Credits: KeelvarKeelvar allows customers to canvass an array of direct and indirect procurement bid information from suppliers and then analyze multiple awarding scenarios based on those criteria and other constraints. (Direct procurement is spending on goods and services that drive tangible profit, whereas indirect procurement is spending on goods and services needed for day-to-day operations.) Using the platform, they can also launch and run new bidding events. Algorithms sort through data on supply chain disruptions and vendors, cleansing it and extracting information before offering recommendations.During the pandemic, Holland said that pharmaceutical companies used Keelvar to spot bad actors and inflated prices in the supply chain, and responded by rerouting goods through other means of transportation (e.g., via ground instead of air).\u201cAI-powered sourcing bots are essentially agents designed to execute several tasks and reason about inputs they receive, such as identifying suppliers to invite to a bidding event, managing supplier communications and bid analysis, and recommending award decisions,\u201d Keelvar explains on its website. \u201c[The] bots can establish spot bidding or mini-tender events within a matter of minutes, managing and automating mundane tasks such as inviting carriers, collecting and validating bid data, messaging bid status updates, conducting necessary rate card and lane information lookups, and generating award recommendations.\u201dVenture capitalists see the opportunity in the supply chain. Last year was a banner year, when VCs put $11.3 billion in financing toward vendors in the sector, according to Crunchbase. Keelvar is a beneficiary, having today closed a $24 million Series B funding round led by 83North with participation from Elephant, Mosaic, and Paua.\u201cEnterprises were blindsided when the pandemic shut down the global supply chain. As issues persist and show no sign of relenting, C-suites are finally recognizing that intelligent automation is a must-have,\u201d 83North partner Philip Chopin said in a statement. \u201cKeelvar s unique automation and optimization solutions empower procurement teams by helping them easily define their needs and react faster to market changes. The company s blue-chip customer list and incredible retention and satisfaction rates are a powerful testament to their technology, team, and vision.\u201dKeelvar competes with a number of companies in the procurement solutions space, including Fairmarkit, Tealbook, and Contingent. But while remaining vague about Keelvar s technological advantages, as well as revenue, Holland pointed to the company s overall growth in recent months. Keelvar, which plans to expand its 85-person headcount to over 130 by the end of the year, currently has over 70 enterprise customers and \u201cthousands\u201d of paying users.\u201c[Recently,] we ve significantly expanded our customer base and team, as well as successfully launched [air] and ocean bots for sourcing automations,\u201d Holland said. \u201cWe ve [also] successfully grown as a remote-first organization, doubling our workforce.\u201dThe Series B brings Keelvar s total raised to $43 million. Holland said that the company plans to put it toward product development and expanding in the U.S.",

        "text": "Mass transit has made a rebound with the return of city life post-COVID 19, and today a startup that s building tech to help it run more smoothly is announcing a big round of funding to meet the rush. Optibus, which uses AI to help public transportation bodies and their mass transit partners plan and operate their networks, has raised $100 million, funding that it will be using to continue expanding its product set and wider business footprint, CEO and co-founder Amos Haggiag said in an interview in London this week.The Series D funding values Optibus at $1.3 billion, which the Israeli startup says makes it the first \u201cunicorn\u201d in the public transportation tech space.Insight Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners, Verizon Ventures, Pitango First & Pitango Growth, Tencent and SOMV Momentum are among the investors in this round, which brings the total raised by the startup to $260 million and is coming about 14 months after Optibus raised $107 million in a Series C at a $400 million to $500 million valuation.That s a big leap, but in a period where a lot of growth-stage startups have found it a challenge to raise more money, Optibus stands out as an example of how the right mix of timing and traction can still close deals.The company now has customers in more than 1,000 cities, double the number of a year ago; and its employees have also grown to 300 (up from 120). In total, Optibus is being used to track and power about 2.5 billion trips on buses, on-street trams, light rails and subways annually around the globe. (Note: In the public transport push for more multi-modal options for users, Optibus also incorporates data about public bike, scooter and taxi access points but doesn t provide data about their movements \u2014 not now, at least.)Optibus s rise underscores a critical moment for the world of public transportation.Mass transit services like buses and subways took a huge hit in the last couple of years, with numbers of users declining by some 80% globally in the wake of COVID-19: people stayed home more to work; when they did go out, they generally wanted to avoid contact with others and crowds so stayed off public transport; and public transport organizations themselves also reduced services and passenger flow to fit with public health rules.That has largely come back now, with average numbers now at 80-90% of where they were pre-COVID, Haggiag said. But that s not the full story.Even before COVID-19 hit, he added, mass transportation use was seeing a general decline in a number of cities as people were choosing to walk, bike and scoot \u2014 or order rides from the new wave of e-hailing taxi-type services \u2014 alongside the ever-popular option of using their own cars.But at the same time, he added, cities are growing, with the concept of \u201cmega city\u201d becoming more common and\u2026 more mega, and that is playing out in a surge for needing more mass transit.\u201cBy far one of the biggest demographic changes in our time and in history will be the mega city,\u201d Haggiag said. \u201cWe re not talking hundreds or thousands or even millions more people in cities, but billions.\u201dSo while Optibus is often parachuted into established public transportation systems \u2014 where \u201cEverything is old tech, or just no tech at all,\u201d in Haggiag s estimation \u2014 it is also finding a new wave of greenfield projects in emerging markets where the mega city trend is really surging. In one example, it s working with Kampala in Uganda to build a new bus system from scratch, he said.This is playing into how Optibus itself is growing as a business.The startup first made its name by way of its AI-based planning tools \u2014 used to help transportation organizations ascertain how best to manage mass transit resources against rush hours, slow periods, social distancing rules and more, which they in turn also used to share data with to customer-facing services like real-time, third-party navigation apps.Now, Optibus is moving into a wider set of features. These include, most recently, a new analytics engine, called Ridership Insights that provides more granular data based on routes, including boarding and alighting data based on time and date, to make more informed planning decisions.And, coming in June, it will be launching an operations stack that will give its customers an end-to-end platform for people management, and to provide real-time data and services to their drivers and other employees. This potentially will expand to include systems that replace the radio systems that bus drivers use to get updates on, say, a sudden traffic change due to an accident on the route.Optibus is building a lot from the ground up, but it has also been snapping up smaller transport startups to bolt on new tech and services. Last month, it announced the acquisition of Portland, Oregon-based Trillium, which it acquired for around $10 million. To complement Optibus s existing B2B platform, Trillium has built tech to provide data to passengers, used both to populate more accurate data in third-party navigation apps but also potentially for transportation operators to build and provide their own apps, by way of a white-label service.\u201cTransport agencies understand that most of the world uses apps like Google Maps so the first focus is to make sure that the data is super accurate for those,\u201d said Haggiag. But building their own apps is a no-brainer, a way to provide more direct information and to glean more data about their customers and their usage, to sell tickets directly and more. \u201cThere is a chance to show all of that more immediately in apps,\u201d he added.In terms of competitors, Haggiag said that there are a number of localized players providing parts of the \u201ctech stack\u201d \u2014 if you could call it that \u2014 services to help monitor traffic and send out messaging to users, and ERP and CRM systems that are used by organizations but do not join up with the data showing now networks really work. Joining all of that up together is what seems to be attracting the customers.5 lessons from \u2018Star Wars  that can transform startup managers  strategies and tactics\u201cOptibus combines innovation and public transportation expertise like no one else in the industry. Their software is revolutionizing our business and day-to-day operations, as well as the passenger experience. Optibus is the future of public transportation and we celebrate this fantastic milestone with them,\u201d said Carla Stockton-Jones, U.K. managing director at Stagecoach Group, the largest public transport operator in the U.K., in a statement.\u201cOptibus has modernized the industry and helped cities around the world bring quality and reliable transportation to their residents. As long-time investors in the company, we re excited to continue our partnership with Amos and the team,\u201d said Teddie Wardi, managing director at Insight Partners in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to working with Optibus as they continue to grow and scale up.\u201d\u201cFor SOMV Momentum, Optibus represents everything that is great in tech; digitizing and disrupting the basic functions of society in a way that serves the common good, both in quality of service and environmental impact, whilst also being an island of solid growth, which is of prime importance for us in current market conditions,\u201d added Merav Rotem Naaman, general partner at SOMV Momentum. \u201cWe are very proud to be continuing this journey with Amos and his amazing team.\u201d",

        "title": "When your startup s core mission is set to be overturned",
        "text": "Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.Hey Jane, a digital health startup that scales access to abortion pills, makes sense. It s a direct-to-consumer pharmacy that aims to meet consumers where they are, which is especially important as the pandemic s extended stay continues.Hey Jane s core product has significant red tape to deal with. It s main product, abortion pills, are banned or restricted in several states. Add in the fact that Roe v. Wade is set to be overturned, and the world s future could clash with the startup s mission to expand healthcare. Hey Jane pretty much underscores the potential \u2014 and promise \u2014 of telehealth startups. But it also operates at the heart of an over-politicized issue.Earlier this month, I wrote about how digital health startups are bracing for a post-Roe world. Then, Hey Jane co-founder Kiki Freedman said that the overturn makes abortion care via mail \u201cnow likely to be the most viable form of access for most of the country.\u201d A hurdle, she expects, will be a lack of education among consumers on medication-induced abortions. The majority of abortions performed in the U.S. are via medication, except she says that a minority of people are educated about the nuances of medical abortion. \u201cIt s imperative that we continue to educate people about this safe, effective and common abortion option,\u201d she wrote in a statement.But now I want to do a follow-up to these next-day reactions. Next week, I plan to interview Freedman for TechCrunch s Equity podcast and ask her about how to build a company when the mission may be irreversibly challenged by our government; we ll talk about the origin story, and how they plan to pivot in the future. I want her to tell me what the world is getting wrong about telemedicine s ability to answer the biggest questions in health right now, and where startups could fit into the solution going forward. Also, are they actually raising a growth round? For the answers, make sure to tune into the Equity episode wherever you get podcasts, and, heck, why not start now?\u00a0In the rest of this newsletter, we ll talk about another round of startup layoffs, why your MVP isn t the MVP, and a fintech company betting that it can make even your local credit card crave some Netflix & Chill time.\u00a0 As always, you can support me by forwarding this newsletter to a friend or following me on Twitter or my blog.More layoffs in startuplandThere s unfortunately more where last week came from. Tech workers experienced another hard week of layoffs and hiring freezes, coming from startups such as Section4, Latch and DataRobot. We rounded up some of the known workforce reductions in one post.\u00a0Here s why it s important: Impact was felt across industries ranging from education to security, as well as stages from a post\u2013Series A startup to a recently SPAC d business. To me, that signals just how pervasive this pull-back truly is, regardless of what phase your company may be in. It s not just the cash-rich tech unicorns that are cutting staff; it s the early stage startups, too.Tech layoffs don t happen to companies, they happen to people\u00a0Need advice on navigating a tough startup market? Start here\u00a0How many unicorns are just pi\u00f1atas filled with expired candy?Top Twitter execs, including heads of revenue and consumer products, are out following Musk dealThe half-billion-dollar profit swing that led to Better.com s myriad layoffsImage Credits: PM images (opens in a new window) / Getty ImagesYour MVP is neither minimal, viable nor a productI ve been thinking about this headline from Haje Jan Kamps for the past week because it challenges one of those preconceived startup notions that everyone else happily adopts without too much of a fight. Aka, my sweet spot (and my weakness). In this op-ed, Kamps gets into why MVP is \u201csuch a profound misnomer\u201d and what to focus on instead.Here s why it s important: Kamps  new framework, and series of questions that you should be asking your first product, should make the complexities of MVPs a little more approachable. And II ll end with his kicker:\u201cI don t have a suggestion for a better name for MVP, just don t fall into the trap of thinking of it as a product, being viable or, necessarily, being small, simple or easy. Some MVPs are complex. The idea, though, is to spend as little of your precious resources as you can to get an answer to your questions.\u201dA venture firm gets rewarded for selling at the market top\u2018Move fast and break things  is a bad idea for health tech startupsMore money doesn t mean more growth, and other startup mythsImage Credits: Getty ImagesJay-Z s Queen AFor the deal of the week that may have flown under your radar, I choose Altro! Co-founded by Michael Broughton and Ayush Jain, this fintech startup believes that credit access should be free \u2014 so it found an atypical way to help people build credit.Here s why it s important: Altros, which raised an $18 million Series A this week, helps folks build credit through recurring payment forms such as digital subscriptions to Netflix, Spotify and Hulu. It stands out because a lot of banks targeted toward low-income, historically disenfranchised people want to circumvent credit scores altogether \u2014 while Altros wants to tweak access to an established system.

What caused this bloodbath? Well, a major catalyst was the disastrous implosion of Terra s Luna token as a result of ongoing stablecoin woes.In their interview this week, Lucas and Anita chat with Kevin Rose. Kevin is a serial entrepreneur who founded Digg in the early 2000s and is now an investor at True Ventures and a co-founder of the Proof Collective.

Every Monday, Grace and Alex scour the news and record notes on what s going on to kick off the week.Happily once again we did not start the day by talking about Elon Musk and Twitter, though the news was not really very good:Stocks are down sharply around the world. And crypto prices, which track larger asset prices, are also sharply lower in the last day, and week.Uber s CEO told his company that things are changing. Adjusted EBITDA is out, FCF is in. Hiring? Going to slow. Capital expenses? Those will get harder looks, and so on. During the show, we asked about the slowdown, and how it may, or may not impact the bouyant crypto startup market.Neat funding rounds from Pyramid, which raised $120 million, and Paymob, which raised $50 million.Episode 514: Tech layoffs don t happen to companies, they happen to peopleThis is our Wednesday show, where we niche down to a single topic, think about a question and unpack the rest. This week, Natasha and Alex\u00a0asked:\u00a0What does the most recent wave of layoffs mean for tech workers?The question comes after Natasha s recent Startups Weekly column,\u00a0\u201cThe Great Resignation, meet the Great Reset.\u201d In the piece, which included a roundup of recent tech layoffs, she explored the idea of employee whiplash, and why this moment in pullback is different than what we saw in March 2020.The goal of the episode was to humanize the tech layoffs we ve seen ripple across the startup ecosystem, from buzzy, big names like Cameo, On Deck and Robinhood, to B2B platforms like Workrise and Thrasio.\u00a0As our piece last week notes, the common thread between most of these layoffs, according to founders, is that there s been a shift in the market and a serious pivot in business is required. A pivot, that is, that hurts the employees that built your product up after high demand.Episode 515: How close are we to understanding what s going on?This week we recorded live, which is always good fun, meaning that we took some questions from the audience. If you want that version of the show, we have a YouTube archive of it here.For those of you more into audio, we have you covered here. Natasha, Alex and Grace teamed up with Julio and Yashad to host the shindig, allowing us to cover the following:The end of iPod, a time to reflect on technology trends.The exit of a Modern Fertility co-founder, and the MARA round bringing more money to Africa s fintech scene.From there it was onto the Terra crash, Coinbase s earnings and the general sentiment shift in the crypto scene.Next up was Tiger and the downturn in startup valuations.And we closed on some personal notes.And that s the rundown from the week \u2014 send us a tweet if you have suggestions, or questions.

        "title": "Revel founder Frank Reig a year later on driving EV adoption in big cities",
        "text": "Almost exactly a year ago, we interviewed Revel founder and CEO Frank Reig when Revel was on the cusp of expanding into multiple business lines beyond its original scope of providing shared electric mopeds. Today, we re taking a second look to see how far the startup has come, and the distance it has to cover to achieve its stated goal of helping urban cities transition to electric transport.Revel started its moped business in New York in 2018, and it has since expanded into Miami, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. But if you just heard about the startup for the first time today, you might not even think of it as a moped sharing company. Over the past year, Revel has pivoted sharply toward building fast-charging hubs for electric vehicles, launching its first \u201cSuperhub\u201din NYC last June.Along the way, the company also started (and quietly shut down) an e-bike subscription service and launched an all-electric ride-hailing service in NYC.Reig recently told me the company is aiming to build 200 fast-charging stalls in NYC by the end of this year, \u201cand we re shooting for hundreds more in 2023 on top of that.\u201d Revel s ride-hailing business, which currently has 50 Teslas driving around Manhattan, will also expand alongside the EV charging infrastructure, he said.\u201cThe way we think about stations is at scale. Revel s not interested in the one charger at a Walgreens. That doesn t do anything for the city, and it doesn t accelerate any transition. The only way to drive EV adoption in cities is with a real network of infrastructure, which does not exist right now. Until a company like Revel builds it all, this EV transition is just a lot of marketing and talk.\u201dWe sat down with Reig to talk about Revel s business, the company s recent funding from Blackrock, the need to work grid stability into its business model and how the company thinks about profitability.This interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity. TC: It s been a year since our interview, and Revel feels like a different company now! Back then, moped sharing was your main business, but now the focus is on EV charging infrastructure. Do you still have plans to expand your moped business?Frank Reig: We have 6,000 mopeds across four markets, so it s a sizable business that generates a sizable amount of revenue. At this point, we re sort of waiting for COVID to be over officially until we really start to think about expanding our micromobility footprint.That said, some of the mopeds in our fleet are three, four years old. So we re starting to think about the next moped technology we want to use. How do we want to think about reinvesting in our markets, in our fleets?You recently closed a $126 million Series B round led by Blackrock, and a lot of that s going into your EV charging hubs. I believe you said you re going to build another one in New York?We re building many more in New York.Everybody keeps talking about the EV transition. Everyone keeps talking about how auto OEMs are saying they re never going to produce another gas vehicle again. They re falling over themselves to outdo one another. No one s talking about where all these vehicles are going to charge. That story has not changed from last year. If anything, it s gotten worse. Infrastructure is just so lacking, especially in some of these big cities like New York.New York state passed a law that said all vehicles sold after 2035 will have to be electric, and 20% of new vehicles sold will have to be electric by 2025. We literally have millions of vehicles that need to transition to electric, and there s really no charging in sight, which is where our strategy comes into play.",

        "text": "Gogoro is launching its Smartscooters and battery-swapping technology in Tel Aviv this summer, with plans to expand into other Israeli cities in the future, the company said on Wednesday.The news follows Gogoro s public debut via a SPAC merger last month. At the time, founder and CEO Horace Luke told TechCrunch the company would focus its expansion plans on dense Asian cities where two-wheeled vehicles are already popular. At the same time, Luke said Gogoro would continue to grow in its home market of Taiwan, as well as in newer and larger markets like China, India and Indonesia.Similar to Gogoro s moves in other markets, Gogoro is partnering with local companies that have existing infrastructure and resources to make for an easier launch. In China, that was Yadea and Dachangjiang Group, two Chinese motorcycle manufacturers, and in India it was two-wheel maker Hero MotoCorp. For its Israeli expansion, Gogoro is partnering with two-wheel distributor Metro Motor and gas and energy company Paz Group, the company said.Gogoro s partnerships in China and India involve those brands selling their own scooters that have been decked out with Gogoro s technology and components. However in Israel, Gogoro will sell its proprietary Smartscooters \u2014 specifically the S2 ABS and 2 Plus, to start \u2014 through Metro Motor, according to a spokesperson for Gogoro.Paz will deploy the Gogoro Network GoStations at its gas stations and other appropriate consumer-centric locations, said Gogoro, noting that it plans to start with 10 battery-swapping stations, or GoStations, at launch, and will expand to 35 this year.\u201cWe are excited to be launching in Israel, one of the most innovative and technology-forward countries in the world to establish a new era of urban two-wheel mobility,\u201d said Luke in a statement. \u201cGogoro was created to introduce a mass market shift to sustainable energy in densely populated cities by establishing an intelligent urban ecosystem that introduces a new refueling system for electric two-wheel vehicles.\u201dToday, Gogoro manages more than 350,000 battery swaps per day, said Luke, noting that the company had exceeded 275 million battery swaps since 2015.Gogoro s public debut could supercharge EV battery swapping across the globe",

        "title": "Identitypass,\u00a0an identity verification API for Africa, raises $2.8M seed funding",
        "text": "Mobile penetration in Africa is growing impressively at about 46% as more people come online for the very first time. In turn, this has increased the market opportunity for startups, especially fintechs and e-commerce, which try to provide various solutions to meet the financial needs of the populace.But to do that, these businesses must carry out certain identity verifications and KYC to combat fraud, among other things. Many platforms power these KYC processes, and one of them, Identitypass, is today announcing that it has raised $2.8 million in seed funding, months after graduating from Y Combinator. The round also comes a few months after the startup raised $360,000 in pre-seed investment last November, bringing its total funding to $3.1 million.Reports say African businesses lose $4 billion annually to cybercrime. The global figure for this occurrence stands at $1 trillion. Thus, the need for fintechs and digital businesses in Africa to perform stringent KYC and verification checks on their customers.However, for the folks at Lagos-based Identitypass, it wasn t the love for reducing the high rates of fraud that led them to start the company. According to co-founder and CEO Lanre Ogungbe, the team was initially building a platform that required consumers to use biometrics (face, fingerprints or voice) and cards to make payments. But while developing the platform, they encountered issues performing verification checks. Hence, the decision to pivot.\u201cAt the point of when we re building it [the payments solution], there was no one in the market that had the kind of infrastructure that we wanted to use. We wanted to build a substitute for authentication. That was it,\u201d the CEO told TechCrunch in an interview.The team reached out to fintechs asking how they solve fraud and identity issues, seeing growing demand from that segment. The overarching feedback, Ogungbe said, was a setup involving an in-house compliance team and enacting thresholds on transactions. Customers would need to pass further investigative checks to make transactions above the threshold for the latter.Meanwhile, some of these fintechs did not precisely have excellent KYC processes because customers only had to fill in very few data points at their onboarding stages. \u201cWe knew it would never work for us,\u201d said Ogungbe, who founded the company with Niyi Adegboye, Ebuka Obi\u00a0and Tolu Adetuyi last year. \u201cToday, we have basic authentication using OTPs or a four-pin password, but by starting Identitypass, we wanted to introduce more authentication options into the market.\u201dNext, Identitypass approached various agencies and authorities countrywide to get licenses and certifications needed for authorizing checks across a full spectrum of verification points. It launched with one data point in January 2020. But now, 200 active businesses across fintech, e-commerce, education and mobility connect to 18 data points to verify their customers  identities on the platform. These businesses are based in Nigeria, the U.K., Kenya the U.S. and India.\u201cThe core of our business is making it possible for digital businesses in Africa to easily verify and validate that their customers are who they say they are,\u201d the chief executive said.\u201cBefore we came into the market, someone could pick another person s BVN and use that to assess a loan facility,\u201d said the founder explaining why Identitypass takes a lot of data points into cognizance. \u201cBut with technologies like ours, we can do this kind of verification to tell that the person submitting the BVN, phone number or bank details isn t the owner.\u201dIdentitypass has processed more than 1 million unique verifications since launch. These end points are government-approved IDs, such as national IDs, driver licenses, international passports, bank verification numbers (BVN), phone numbers, vehicle plate numbers, debit cards, security watchlists and tax history. Depending on the number of end points a business connects to, the identity and verification platform charges between 10 cents to 20 cents on every verification it executes.Recently, the two-year-old company launched a SaaS platform in addition to its APIs. Ogungbe said this new offering \u2014 software rather than a plug-and-play solution \u2014 gives Identitypass an advantage over identical players in the market, such as fellow YC-batchmate Dojah and older startup Smile Identity.\u201cThat makes us different from anyone in the market because today, we re the only providers of both an API and a SaaS-based solution for verification. To add, we have more data points than most providers in the region. And the way we use data and biometrics for verification, no other player in the market uses it that way.\u201dThis confidence in being a \u201cmarket leader\u201d is propelling the company into new territory: selling to international clients. On the call, the CEO cited an event that transpired last month when U.S.-based Mercury restricted the accounts of a few African startups due to compliance issues. He said Identitypass could prevent such events in the future if it onboards companies of Mercury s stature to conduct checks on individuals and businesses from Africa.Mercury restricted a number of accounts linked to African startups and didn t exactly say why\u201cWe will not just stop there,\u201d Ogungbe said. \u201cWe would also work with many regulatory agencies to develop a top-notch data security framework across Africa. Lastly, we will work with multiple alliances and form more formidable and strategic partnerships across different countries in Africa.\u201dPowered by this seed funding led by MaC Venture Capital, Identitypass plans to expand its existing infrastructure, roll out new verticals around compliance, security and data collection, push into new African countries and make new hires to its 14-man team. Y Combinator, Soma Capital, True Capital Fund and Sherwani Capital are among its other investors.Smile Identity raises $7M to build KYC and identity verification tools for AfricaYC W22 batch nets 24 African startups, including 18 from Nigeria",

        "text": "Canoo s first-quarter earnings shows a company burning through cash, no near-term revenue and a warning that it may not have enough money to stay in business.Shares of Canoo, which were down 5% Tuesday, fell another 17.5% in after-market trading following the release of its earnings. It has since recovered and is now down more than 11%.Canoo has had a tumultuous and short history. The company s vehicle designs, the first of which debuted in spring 2019, garnered praise and made it a buzzy EV startup. Just last month, Canoo was even selected by NASA to build the ground crew transportation vehicles for the Artemis space exploration program.But Canoo has also suffered from a long string of problems and controversies, including internal drama, the exit of its co-founders, legal issues, an SEC investigation and production delays.This latest earnings report paints an increasingly grim picture for Canoo s future.The EV startup, which earlier this week filed suit against one of its major investors in an attempt to reclaim $61 million in profits from allegedly suspicious stock trades, closed out the quarter with $104.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. That means the company, which currently has no revenue, burned through about $120 million since the fourth quarter.Canoo s net loss reached $125.4 million, compared to $15.2 million in the same quarter last year, with net cash used in operating activities totaling $120.3 million compared to $53.9 million in Q1 2021.\u201cOur business plans require a significant amount of capital,\u201d reads a regulatory filing from Canoo. \u201cIf we are unable to obtain sufficient funding or do not have access to capital, we will be unable to execute our business plans and could be required to terminate or significantly curtail our operations and our prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\u201dCanoo announced in August 2020 that it had reached an agreement to merge with special purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp., with a market valuation of $2.4 billion. At the time, Canoo said it was able to raise $300 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, including investments from funds and accounts managed by BlackRock.That PIPE investment appears to have not yet been realized. Canoo said during a call with investors Tuesday that it expected a $300 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) related to its merger\u00a0to go through this week, and the company has filed a $300 million universal shelf. That $600 million is necessary to make it to start of production, Canoo CEO Tony Aquila said.Despite that impending money, Canoo still issued a \u201cgoing concern\u201d warning.A going concern qualification means the company may not have enough funds or cannot generate sufficient revenue to satisfy its obligations as it comes due. Among other looming production deadlines, including more than 17,500 pre-orders, Canoo\u00a0said it would deliver multiple customized models for NASA, which are to be based on its lifestyle vehicle model, by June 2023. Canoo s financial concerns call the EV maker s ability to meet that commitment into question.NASA did not immediately respond to requests for more information.When an investor asked about production guidelines for the NASA vehicles, Aquila dodged, saying that information was confidential, but that Canoo was hyper-focused on building up the factory in Bentonville, Arkansas, which is expected to produce \u201c20,000-ish vehicles\u201d for Canoo, said Aquila.Canoo first announced the Bentonville factory in November last year, saying at the time that it would also move up the start of production of the lifestyle vehicle from early 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2022. That guidance was not updated during Tuesday s earnings call.Perhaps the only bright spot in Canoo s earnings was it that received $30.4 million as part of a settlement agreement with Dutch automotive manufacturing company VDL Nedcar. Canoo had prepaid VDL Nedcar the money as part of a vehicle manufacturing contract to build its \u201clifestyle EV.\u201d The partnership ended in December as Canoo explored a new deal with VDL Groep.",

        "text": "\u201cBy 2024, 60% of the data used for the development of AI and analytics projects will be synthetically generated.\u201d This is a prediction from Gartner that you will find in almost every single article, deck or press release related to synthetic data.We are repeating this quote here despite its ubiquity because it says a lot about the total addressable market of synthetic data.Let s unpack: First, describing synthetic data that is \u201csynthetically generated\u201d may seem tautologic, but it is also quite clear: We are talking about data that is artificial/fake and created, rather than gathered in the real world.Next, there s the core of the prediction \u2014 that synthetic data will be used in the development of most AI and analytics projects. Since such projects are on the rise, the correlation is that the market for synthetic data is also set to grow.Last but not least is the time horizon. In our startup world, 2024 is almost today, and people at Gartner already have a longer-term prediction: Some of its team published a piece of research \u201cForget About Your Real Data \u2014 Synthetic Data Is the Future of AI.\u201d\u201cThe future of AI\u201d is the kind of promise that investors like to hear, so it s no surprise that checks have been flowing into synthetic data startups.In 2022 alone, MOSTLY AI raised a $25 million Series B round led by Molten Ventures; Datagen landed a $50 million Series B led by Scale Venture Partners, and Synthesis AI pocketed a $17 million Series A.Synthetic data startups that have raised significant amounts of funding already serve a wide range of sectors, from banking and healthcare to transportation and retail. But they expect use cases to keep on expanding, both inside new sectors as well as those where synthetic data is already common.To understand what s happening, but also what s coming if synthetic data does get more broadly adopted, we talked to various CEOs and VCs over the last few months. We learned about the two main categories of synthetic data companies, which sectors they address, how to size the market and more.The tip of the icebergQuiet Capital s founding partner, Astasia Myers, is one of the investors bullish about synthetic data and its applications. She declined to disclose whether she invested in this space, but said that \u201cthere s a lot to be excited about in the synthetic data world.\u201dWhy the enthusiasm? \u201cBecause it gives teams faster access to data in a secure way at a lower cost,\u201d she told TechCrunch. \u201cWe can simply say that the TAM of synthetic data and the TAM of data will converge.\u201dOfir Zuk (Chakon)Access to large troves of data has become critical for machine learning teams, and real data is often not up to the task, for different reasons. This is the gap that synthetic data startups are hoping to fill.There are two main contexts in which these startups focus: structured data and unstructured data. The former refers to the kind of datasets that sit in tables and spreadsheets, while the latter points toward what we could call media files, such as audio, text and visual data.\u201cIt makes sense to distinguish between structured and unstructured synthetic data companies,\u201d Myers said, \u201cbecause the synthetic data type is applied to different use cases and therefore different buyers.\u201d",

        "text": "Israeli trip-planning app Moovit is integrating with Orlando-based autonomous shuttle startup Beep, which will allow riders to view options for taking Beep shuttles alongside other forms of transit, like buses or trains. The partnership also brings Moovit s routing and fleet management software to Beep s backend, technology that calculates dynamic routes, vehicle location and dispatch services, according to Moovit.While Moovit has integrated with various forms of new mobility lately, including a handful of micromobility companies, this is the first time the startup has integrated with an autonomous shuttle, as well as the first time Moovit users in the U.S. are able to hail an autonomous vehicle via the app, according to Uli Gal-Oz, Moovit s VP of business development.\u201cAutonomous vehicles are going to be increasingly prevalent in the mobility sphere,\u201d Gal-Oz told TechCrunch. \u201cManaging AV deployments and incorporating these services into Moovit s [mobility-as-a-service (MaaS)] platform fits with this broader strategy and brings Moovit even more close to its vision of MaaS.\u201dThe Moovit app will be available to Beep riders only in Lake Nona, Florida, a 17-square-mile master-planned community in Orlando where Beep has been running an autonomous shuttle service since 2019. The company says it has carried more than 50,000 passengers in that area over the past three years, connecting residential, commercial, retail, recreational and medical services.Moovit users in Lake Nona, Florida will be able to see real-time info about their Beep autonomous shuttle. Image Credits: MoovitRiders can currently book seats on a Beep shuttle via the Moovit app, which is unique for Moovit, as it usually directs users to other apps for bookings and payments. And while Beep s service in Lake Nona is currently free, Moovit does have mobile payment capabilities, so when it becomes a paid service, riders will be able to pay via the Moovit app, as well, said Gal-Oz. Moovit users are also able to track the Beep shuttle in real time and view estimated arrival and drop-off times.\u201cLake Nona is a great example of a smart and connected community that is achieving innovative mobility initiatives with the right partners,\u201d said Uli Gal-Oz, Moovit VP of business development. \u201cThe combination of Moovit s consumer interface and on-demand solution, coupled with Beep s AV fleet, is a powerful one. It has the potential to expand ever more into Lake Nona and other cities in the U.S. to solve first- and last-mile challenges.\u201dThe two companies plan to expand their integration to additional project areas across the country, such as Tradition, a master-planned community in Port Lucie, Florida, according to a statement. Beep currently operates in about nine cities across the U.S., but plans on expanding its presence further.In March, the company raised $25 million to level up its autonomous software, a round that saw participation from Intel, which owns Moovit. The month prior, Beep also said it would team up with another Intel company, AV tech company Mobileye, as well as German manufacturer Benteler, to build and deploy \u201cautonomous movers,\u201d or self-driving shuttles, across the U.S. in 2024.",

        "text": "Hunting down a beat-up-looking shared electric scooter that has the germs of goodness-knows-who all over the handlebars is not Unagi s idea of sexy shared micromobility. Instead, the e-scooter manufacturer is launching a more exclusive version that will see its slick e-scooters available to rent at hotels, luxury apartments and coworking spaces.\u201cUnagi on Demand,\u201d as the offering is called, is kicking off at the Hoxton Hotel in Los Angeles, as well as Common Luxury Apartments, Nap York Sleeping Pods and The Yard Coworking in New York City. The move signals a shift in Unagi s current business model, which has mainly focused on sales and subscriptions of its e-scooters. \u201cThis fits into our overall strategy as we re choosing locations that don t require the brutal logistics and unit economics that ride-sharing services are subjected to, that from our perspective make those models very hard to thrive,\u201d David Hyman, CEO and founder of Unagi, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt also functions as a marketing vehicle for our scooter rental subscription service. We like for people to get exposed to experience in a hotel and then want one for their everyday use. Essentially, it s not our core business, but complementary. We started it because of numerous inbound requests.\u201dThat said, Hyman thinks Unagi On-Demand can be a meaningful revenue driver for the business in the long run, given that there s still plenty of space to expand beyond these initial pilots. To start, Unagi will have six vehicles at the Hoxton, another six at Nap York, eight at one Common Luxury location and 12 vehicles across three Yard locations.\u201cObviously getting large-scale hotel chains and real estate developers with mass quantities of properties is the goal,\u201d said Hyman, adding that Unagi has a significant rollout with a partnership that it can t yet announce.At the moment, the companies offering Unagi s scooters receive a revenue share of anywhere from zero to 10%, according to Hyman, who says many are simply interested in adding the scooters to offer guests more convenience.\u201cUnagi is a perfect fit with the culture, community, and design focus of our coworking spaces.\u201d said Michelle Segev, senior operations manager at The Yard.\u00a0 \u201cUnagi adds a super convenient transportation amenity to members at the Yard, allowing them to focus on their business rather than the logistics of running errands and getting to meetings around the city\u201dGiven the way the sharing and subscription economy is going, where access is more important to most people than ownership, Unagi might be on to something. The company is currently partnering with Tulu, which offers on-demand rentals of home products and other items, such as Unagi scooters or VR headsets, at dormitories, hotels and luxury apartments. Tulu recently closed a $20 million Series A and is set to expand its model.Unagi On-Demand also touches on the growing popularity of electric scooters for convenient travel in urban environments that aren t too car-centric. At the same time, by choosing the clientele, Unagi continues to position itself as a trendy, luxury brand.\u00a0Unagi s Model One scooter is currently priced at around $1,000, but its newest scooter, the Model Eleven, complete with advanced rider assistance features, can cost more than $2,800. Renting to Model One costs about $50 per month.\u201cThe private location of the scooters provides an alternative to public shared scooters that are often in disrepair, have empty batteries and litter the urban landscape,\u201d the company said in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cUnagi scooters are spotless, charged and ready-to-ride exclusively for guests. Scanning a QR code is all that s required to start an hourly or daily rental, and Unagi pricing is significantly less expensive than public scooters offered by companies such as Bird or Lime.\u201dUnagi says it is charging anywhere from $5 to $8 per hour for use of its scooters, or $15 to $24 for a 12-hour rental. Lime, for example, charges 30 cents per minute plus $1 to unlock in New York. That ends up being about $19 for the hour. In Los Angeles, Bird charges about 25 cents per minute plus $1 to unlock, bringing it to $16 per hour.",

        "text": "Startups need capital and often fundraise from investors. This requires pitching, numbers, stats and a story. And the time has to be correct. The key to timing is easy, according to this CEO: Fundraise when your confidence is high.Each week on TechCrunch Live, investors and entrepreneurs share lessons learned from personal experiences. And Front CEO and co-founder Mathilde Collin knows about fundraising. She raised $138 million from venture capital over several fundraising rounds, including from Frederic Kerrest, COO of Okta and venture capitalist. They spoke on several topics, and the entire TechCrunch Live event is available on YouTube or through a podcast.Timing can make or break a fundraise, and Collin advises to look for outside investment when you feel great \u2014 like you, the founder, feel great. Unfortunately, sometimes this doesn t correlate with your company s numbers.\u201cIt could be you hired someone amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just signed a very big customer \u2014 whatever makes you super confident in the future of this company.\u201dWhy? According to Collin, investors are very good at assessing if a founder is genuine in their motivations, which revolves around confidence and excitement for the company.

        "text": "Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.The Great Resignation, the economic trend of people quitting their jobs in pursuit of other opportunities, has been greeted by a harsh reality: the Great Reset.This week, a spate of tech companies \u2013 largely those valued above $1 billion from their venture capital investors \u2013 announced reductions in their workforce. I wrote three layoff stories in fewer than 24 hours, a cadence I haven t experienced since the beginning of the pandemic. These stories may have the same ledes, but they feel dramatically different.already is pic.twitter.com/FezWy71QOU\u2014 natasha (@nmasc_) May 5, 2022Unlike before, when startups had to lay off employees in response to the sudden shock of the pandemic, today s tech companies are making cuts due to \u2013 more or less \u2013 their own lack of discipline. I have more empathy for a founder who was caught off guard by a pandemic than one who overspent despite knowing that the boom wouldn t exist forever, and is now cutting the same employees that helped them soar. Whiplash, I m hearing from some now former employees, is an understatement.Growth is tricky, and a part of a founder s job is to moonshot their way to scale, but we also need to remember that change was inevitable. Especially for startups that hit product market fit during a once-in-a-lifetime event.The biggest difference between layoffs in 2020 versus layoffs in 2022 is cash, potentially a lifeline. Startups raised massive amounts of capital thanks to larger average deal sizes over the past two years; meaning that some of the capital that was once used to sweeten benefits or candidates  offers may be pivoting to runway. Jason Lemkin, head of SaaStr, put it well on Twitter: \u201cMany startups also lucked out and have years in the bank due to covid rounds\u2026 capital that they wouldn t have had otherwise.\u201dIf you re a founder, now is the time to unlearn some of that lavish spending and focus on conserving what you do have. For employees, let me know which spreadsheets I need to retweet. For more thoughts, read a round-up of all the tech layoffs this past week, and then head to TechCrunch+ for some advice on how to navigate the market.Need advice on navigating a tough startup market? Start hereIn the rest of the newsletter, we re talking about spicy venture firm pivots, fintech drama and a duo of inclusive play in exclusive worlds. As always, you can support me by forwarding this newsletter to a friend or following me on Twitter or my blog. What venture firms are raising despite reckoningA number of venture firms made news this week, either to announce new funding or new strategies. In Afore s case, it s both. The pre-seed firm tells TechCrunch that they closed a $150 million fund and introduced an in-house accelerator of sorts with a standard deal. Going forward, any accepted company will receive $1 million at a $10 million post-money valuation. It s a not-so-subtle dig at Y Combinator and a way for Afore to stand out during a changing market.Here s why it s important: Afore isn t the only firm to change its mind. Backstage Capital told me this week that, after investing in 200 companies, it will now only do follow-on checks in its existing portfolio. For now, that means no net new Backstage companies, even though the firm is growing assets under management.Also, we re hearing that Unusual Ventures  new $485 million fund comes with an impressive promise of full-time help. Early-stage founders, it s definitely a stressful time to be in your seat \u2013 but also clearly a pivotal one.Sequoia, Binance and a16z back Elon Musk s $44 billion Twitter bid Andreessen Horowitz plans $500 million investment in Indian startups The venture slowdown isn t coming \u2013 it s hereIf the earliest investors keep going earlier, what will happen?Will the corporate venture boom lead to an M&A frenzy?

        "text": "It used to be getting from prototyping to manufacturing meant long, expensive trips to places like Shenzhen and a whole lot of trial and error. Fictiv was founded back in 2013 to address some of the biggest pain points of bringing products to market. The San Francisco startup runs what it calls a Digital Manufacturing Ecosystem, which is, effectively, a user-friendly service for doing just that.Client upload a CAD file or 2D drawings, chooses parts and manufacturing methods (3D printing, injection molding, etc.) and the Fictiv system outputs a price, time and other key information. The appeal of such a system is clear, particularly for young hardware firms. It s also easy to see why the San Francisco-based startup is gaining even more traction during the pandemic and resulting supply chain issues.According to CEO Dave Evans, the company manufactured four million parts in 2021 alone. All told, Fictiv says its created 19 million mechanical parts for 3,000 companies.Image Credits: Fictiv\u201cThe pandemic heightened the awareness of customers and their supply chain issues, which helped drive demand for our services \u2014 we manufactured over 4 million parts last year,\u201d Evans said in an email to TechCrunch. \u201cTo ensure our processes and security matched our output, we strengthened our enterprise security with SOC 2 certification to back our new enterprise workflow services. Those services accelerate new product development, cut cycle times for engineer-to-order products, and increase efficiency in maintenance, repair, and operations of production-line tooling.\u201dAll that in mind, the company today announced that it has raised a $100 million Series E. The new round more than doubles Fictiv s funding to date at $192 million. Activate Capital led the round, which also featured Accel, Bill Gates, G2 Venture Partners, Standard Investments, Angeleno Group, Cross Creek and The Westly Group. It s a lot of companies, but $100 million is a lot of dollars.\u201cFictiv has differentiated itself as an innovative digital manufacturing solution that provides not only unprecedented speed but also scalable partnerships that deliver an immediate ROI and end-to-end business value,\u201d Active Capital s David Lincoln said in a release. \u201cWe believe Fictiv is the category leader transforming how companies like Honeywell gain unmatched productivity, efficiency, and enterprise scalability through digitized workflows that dramatically change the speed and quality of manufacturing in markets such as energy, healthcare, space, and transportation.\u201dImage Credits: FictivThe company says the funding will go to \u2014 in part \u2014 focusing on addressing some of the aforementioned supply chain issues with its platform.\u201cFictiv frees companies to focus on building new products that serve their customers,\u201d says Evans. \u201cWe work in concert with manufacturing partners to help companies rationalize their supply chains and consolidate an otherwise fragmented and unwieldy supply base. Our globally distributed network is by design, far more flexible and resilient than a traditional supply chain.\u201d",

        "title": "Norebase raises $1M to allow companies start, scale, and operate in any African country",
        "text": "Startup pitches with promises to provide various services to Africans \u2014 across different sectors \u2014 are commonplace now. And in trying to sweet-talk investors, what s not taken into context or often disregarded is that Africa is a fragmented $3 trillion market. The continent is also home to more than 1.2 billion people with below-average disposable income, most living in landlocked nations.It s one of the few explanations for why intra-continental trade has proven difficult for years. But in 2019, various policymakers across different parts of the continent signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement \u2014 a framework for Africa to be a single market for trade and services \u2014 to make intra-trade less painful (side note: the agreement is yet to make any significant impact.)Adetola Onayemi was part of the negotiation team that saw the agreement take effect in January 2021. His experience from this activity, coupled with working as a technical adviser to the vice president s office in Nigeria a couple of months back, led him to launch Norebase, a trade tech startup that has raised $1 million in a pre-seed round.In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO Onayemi, a lawyer by profession, said the idea for Norebase came after various conversations on how his clients and colleagues in tech could leverage AfCFTA for their businesses.\u201cI had done all this work in policy, ease of doing business, free trade agreement, and I was advising some people in tech who would say, \u2018listen, I just raised new capital to enter new markets, I dont know how I m supposed to navigate it,'\u201d the chief executive told TechCrunch on a call.From Onayemi s point of view, the growth of Africa s digital economy revolves around gains in six segments: education, payments, logistics, transport, identity, and trade. Trade has the least startup activity in a market that received $5 billion in VC funding last year. Tola believes this is because particular skill sets and an understanding of intracontinental nuances are needed to build beneficial solutions. And as someone with extensive knowledge and background, it made sense for him to take up the challenge.\u201cProviding a framework where people can operate and scale their solutions to several markets at once is incredibly important,\u201d said Onayemi, who also co-founded Future Africa, an Africa-focused VC fund. \u201cOur solution is for people in the local market moving into their first market or a company in their fourth market trying to scale their enterprise.\u201dThe traditional options involve the painstaking process of interfacing with various law and accounting firms, trademark registries and hiring a team to manage these processes. Meanwhile, there s also a trust and accountability factor between clients and firms hired to complete incorporation in another country.\u201cPeople can make mistakes in this sort of situation and Norebase has shared learnings over time to help people avoid these mistakes. We aggregate that knowledge and provide one platform that ensures you don t have to worry too much about trust,\u201d the CEO added. \u201cFrom telling us to set up takes days. We know the rules, so you don t have to spend time talking to lawyers and getting documents \u2014 we simplify all that.\u201dOnayemi launched Norebase with Tope Obanla in September 2021. It allows founders and businesses to start and scale across several African countries at once or periodically.\u00a0 According to Norebase, companies that use its platform can be incorporated in any African country within \u201ca few minutes\u201d and expand to new locations in a week. These countries include Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, South Africa, Rwanda, Senegal, Togo, Tanzania, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Mauritius and Burkina Faso.In addition, Norebase upsells on other services as long as they abide by regulatory and compliance requirements. They include opening bank accounts, virtual mailing addresses, and trademark and IP registration. Norebase doesn t have a fixed fee and charges its clients based on the services they want, Onayemi said on the call without commenting on the company s pricing range.Tola Onayemi (CEO, Norebase)Recently, Norebase began offering African companies the option to incorporate in the U.S. It also launched Incorporation API, a plug-and-play service that allows other companies such as payment processors and banks to provide incorporation services to their customers.Here s a use case on how it works. Payment processors such as Flutterwave and Paystack have caps for unregistered merchants on their platforms, limiting the transactions they can make. There s usually a prompt to these merchants to fully register their businesses before resuming usage.The problem with this is that some merchants may refuse to continue this process despite knowing their earnings are at stake. So Norebase s pitch to these payment processors \u2014 and other platforms with stringent KYC and regulatory commitments \u2014 is that via its Incorporation API, they can prevent this churn by letting merchants complete their registration right on their sites.This incorporation-as-a-service plugin positions Norebase as a global player in the trade tech space. It s one of the few companies offering such services, including Firstbase. The service, which is only available for incorporating businesses in Nigeria, the U.S. and Kenya, currently has nine partners; however, the CEO declined to mention their names.On traction, Norebase claims to have delivered 100% month-on-month growth in transaction volumes for the last six months. It has also grown 40% month-on-month growth in revenue during this same period. Some of its regular offering clients include startups we ve covered before, such as Brass, Nestcoin, Edenlife, Orda, Sudo Africa, and others like GetEquity, Workpay, Kloudcommerce and Patricia.\u201cWhat we do multiplies the valuation of almost every startup because then they can access more markets from the get-go,\u201d said the founder of the partners using its platform.Although the company plays in a market with little competition (Lagos-based Sidebrief is one company offering similar services), it won t stay that way for long as the trade tech opportunity \u2014 particularly as African businesses continue to transact with each other and western countries \u2014 is poised to open up in the next couple of years and attract more funding.Pan-African funds Samurai Incubate and Consonance Investment led Norebase s pre-seed round. Other VCs include Sahil Lavingia of Gumroad, Kinfolk VC, Future Africa, Ventures Platform, Microtraction, Boleh Venture, Voltron Capital, Wuri Ventures and Afropeneur. The round also welcomed participation from well-known executives in Africa s tech ecosystem, including Shola Akinlade, CEO of Paystack; Odunayo Eweniyi, PiggyVest COO; Adia Sowho, the CMO of MTN Nigeria; Seni Sulyman, CEO of BlackOps.Norebase will put the funds into bettering its plug-and-play API, broadening its trademark registration technology stack, and hiring more talent, Onayemi said.",

The company is working with local governments to build hydrogen refueling stations for commercial vehicles.A fuel cell vehicle is a type of electric vehicle propelled by a mixture of hydrogen fuel and oxygen. The technology, which has come in and out of vogue over the last decade for passenger vehicles, has not gained widespread adoption in the U.S. due to a lack of refueling infrastructure, but is becoming increasingly popular for buses and heavy transport.But China, the world s largest hydrogen producer and third-largest market for FCVs behind Japan and South Korea, aims to put 1 million FCVs on the road by 2035.Toyota, Honda and other global automakers have also invested in research and development to bring fuel cell vehicles to market.",

Instead, e-scooters can only be legally ridden as part of government-backed rental pilots.However, England is finally getting around to legalizing private e-scooters for use on roads. Nothing is for certain yet, but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that legislation will be included in the Queen s Speech on May 10. If legalized, private scooters will have to meet similar safety specifications as those in the public trials, namely max speeds of 15.5 miles per hour and automatic lights.If legalized, this will also open up a huge market to the e-scooter makers of the world, and might even spark more homegrown business. Taur, for example, is a British company that has just launched operations in Los Angeles, in large part because the U.K. was dragging its heels on this piece of legislation.It ll also undoubtedly help English cities meet their climate goals. In the U.S., Portland has learned that emissions due to transportation are one of the main reasons the city can t reach its emissions targets. Unfortunately, the city is considering making the problem worse by widening highways\u2026 :eyeroll-emoji:Perhaps not all hope is lost for American cities, though. They just need to get the policy to align with demand. A new study has found that e-bike sales are outpacing electric car sales in the U.S., which makes sense, given market availability of the two types of vehicles. But it s also an encouraging finding! Many people, like parents, are also finding e-cargo bikes to be a nice replacement to the minivan as a vehicle to cart kids around.Meanwhile in the land of shared micromobilityBolt said it will invest about $158 million (\u20ac150 million) in 2022 to scale its scooter and e-bike operations to more than 230,000 scooters and e-bikes across 250+ cities. Earlier this year, the company raised a whopping $709 million, which is no doubt going to help fuel this expansion.Populus is partnering with cities and operators like Bolt, Tier and Voi in a European Union-funded, data-sharing initiative that will measure carbon reductions of micromobility.Voi is launching hundreds of e-scooters in Oslo that will be equipped with Drover AI s computer vision, camera-based scooter ADAS tech, which will help with the ever-annoying problem of scooters on sidewalks.In other news\u2026Cooper Bikes, which is owned by the makers of the Mini Cooper car, dropped four new e-bike models.Indian e-scooter manufacturer Dispatch says it will launch a purpose-built e-scooter (not a kick scooter, one of the moped-looking ones) in Q1 2023 that will be purpose-built to enable shared and commercial applications.Ola Electric has to recall more than 1,400 mopeds after one of them caught fire.See ya next week!\u2014 Rebecca BellanDeal of the weekElon Musk s pursuit to buy Twitter continues to have an impact on Tesla, which is why I m back here writing about a social media platform.The latest example was revealed in a series of regulatory filings that showed he sold 9.6 million shares of Tesla, worth about $8.5 billion. Tesla shares fell more than 11% last week.Musk, who still holds about 16% of the automaker, said in a tweet on Thursday: \u201cNo further TSLA sales planned after today.\u201d It s unclear where the remaining funds needed in the $44 billion deal will come from. Much of Musk s fortune is tied up in Tesla stock.A friendly reminder that if Musk backs out of the deal, he s on the hook for $1 billion, per the termination fee of the deal with Twitter, so at least that amount would be covered by these sales.Other deals that caught my attention this week \u2026BattGenie, a University of Washington startup that developed software to improve performance of batteries, raised $1.5 million in a seed funding round co-led by Powerhouse Ventures and VoLo Earth Ventures.

        "title": "The Interchange: What s the deal with the one-click checkout space?",
        "text": "Welcome to the inaugural edition of The Interchange! If you received this in your inbox, thank you for signing up and your vote of confidence. If you re reading this as a post on our site, sign up here so you can receive it directly in the future. Every week, I ll take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. This will include everything from funding rounds to trends to an analysis of a particular space to hot takes on a particular company or phenomenon. There s a lot of fintech news out there and it s my job to stay on top of it \u2014 and make sense of it \u2014 so you can stay in the know. Let s goooo! Mary AnnOne-click checkout startup Bolt made headlines this week for more reasons than one \u2014 and none of them were particularly good. Let s start from the beginning.On April 26, Bloomberg reported that Bolt was being sued by \u201cits most prominent customer,\u201d Authentic Brands Group (ABG), which owns dozens of retail brands. ABG alleged that San Francisco-based Bolt failed to deliver technology that it promised and that it missed out on over $150 million in online sales during the company s integration with fashion retailer Forever 21. Oof. On top of that, ABG s complaint went on to say that Bolt had raised funding \u201cat increasingly high valuations\u201d by \u201cconsistently overstating\u201d the nature of its integrations with the company s brands in an effort to make it seem like it had more customers than it actually did. For context, Bolt in January raised $355 million in a Series E financing that valued the company at $11 billion.As TC s Christine Hall wrote at the time, Bolt s one-click checkout product aims to give businesses the same technology Amazon has been known for since 1997, and at the same time, incorporate payments and fraud services meant to ensure transactions are real and payments can be accepted.Image Credits: BoltAccording to Bloomberg, Bolt reacted to the complaint by saying that ABG s claims were without merit, and \u201ca transparent attempt\u201d to renegotiate the terms of the companies  agreements.Then on April 28, Insider reported that it heard from unnamed sources that ABG s lawsuit was really an attempt by the firm to claim an ownership stake in the company. Apparently when ABG became a Bolt customer in October 2020, reported Insider, Bolt entered a deal to award the group stock warrants, which give the holder the right to buy shares at a specified price before a specified date \u2014 under certain conditions.According to Insider:The agreement said that if ABG implemented Bolt s checkout and loyalty products at brands like Forever 21 and generated a certain amount in transactions, ABG could buy shares in Bolt for a stake of up to 5%, according to the lawsuit and sources close to the company who also asked for anonymity in discussing pending litigation. Those shares had an estimated value of $20 million at that time, said a source, and could be worth $370 million at Bolt s Series E share price. In a court filing, ABG valued that stake at closer to $500 million.The plot thickens.Meanwhile, The Information reported on April 28 that Bolt is not as dissimilar as competitor Fast \u2014 which recently imploded after raising $120 million over time \u2014 as we all may have thought. If you recall, it was revealed that Fast had only generated $600,000 in revenue all of last year. According to The Information, Bolt s revenue growth has \u201cdramatically\u201d slowed due to competitive pressure the company is likely feeling from the likes of giants such as PayPal and Shopify, who have launched their own one-click checkout services for merchants.Bolt is no stranger to controversy. Its 27-year-old founder, Ryan Breslow, started the company after dropping out of Stanford. He stepped down as CEO in January, and is generally known for his very outspoken rants, such as this series of tweets and recent digs at the media. In an interview with TechCrunch s Connie Loizos that same month, he said the company had signed roughly 10 major deals in the second half of last year, with each being bigger \u201cthan any that Bolt has signed in the company s history previously.\u201d He went on to say that those exclusive partnerships would \u201cgenerate billions in revenue\u201d when rolled out, although he did say the process takes time given the \u201clarge technical lift\u201d of some of these \u201clarge merchants and commerce platforms.\u201dDespite all the challenges that Bolt and Fast have faced, newer players continue to emerge in the space. TC s Mike Butcher last week reported on Volume, a new London-based checkout startup that closed a pre-seed round of $2.4 million led by firstminute Capital and joined by SeedX and Haatch Ventures. As Mike wrote, \u201cVolume s take on this checkout market is \u2014 it says \u2014 about making the checkout process shorter and reducing associated fees. It does this by using the Variable Recurring Payment mandate and also employing biometric security to finalize the purchase.\u201dI reached out to Bolt about all of the above but due to a very crowded inbox, I was only able to connect with the company after this newsletter was published. Here is an update that was published on May 2.A chat with Affirm s CTO, Libor MichalekBNPL is not a new concept; it s just taken off in recent years and become far more mainstream (TechCrunch+ subscription required).Buy now, pay later lets people do exactly what its name suggests \u2014 buy something and pay for it later. The difference between BNPL and credit cards is that rather than charge the full amount of a purchase on a card, consumers can choose to pay for an item in installments.However, there are some that argue BNPL is just another form of debt, which could lead to a discussion on whether companies that enable it are doing it responsibly. In the case of Affirm, one of the space s largest players, co-founder Max Levchin (who also founded PayPal) has been vocal about what he describes as a \u201cmission-based\u201d approach.Ukraine-born Levchin started Affirm in January 2012. The fintech went public in 2021, and while it s trading considerably lower than its 52-week high (which stock isn t?), Affirm is today valued at nearly $9 billion, and its executives remain bullish on the company s future.I sat down with Libor Michalek, president of technology at Affirm, to understand just how the company differentiates itself from its plethora of competitors, what is unique about its technology and strategy and why he thinks using BNPL is much better than using a credit card to pay for purchases. You can read all about it here (TechCrunch+ subscription required).Image Credits: AffirmIs Robinhood a takeover target?Robinhood this week announced it was laying off 9% of its staff, or an estimated 300 workers. This follows Better s move to cut some 1,200 or so people last week and Blend s lay off of 200 workers in the wake of a challenging mortgage environment (among other things in the former s case).In the case of Robinhood, the company has reported some positive news in recent months \u2014 it saw its value rise 25% in March following news that it was extending its equity trading hours toward a goal of supporting 24-hour-a-day activity \u2014 but there have also been myriad struggles at the former unicorn.\u00a0The Financial Revolutionist shared last week a tweet from Ben Carlson of Ritholtz Wealth Management, who basically said that Robinhood appears ripe for an acquisition by Goldman Sachs or Fidelity. To quote FR: Carlson identifies Robinhood s excellent UX and young client base as its greatest assets: the latter especially for Goldman, which has doubled down on targeting younger customers through its Marcus line of products. But Fidelity, which is privately held, might be better suited to buying Robinhood because it doesn t need to worry as much about Robinhood s tarnished reputation (as compared to a publicly traded company that has to answer to opinionated shareholders). And any acquisition would have to handle Robinhood s significant losses, in addition to a potential ban by the SEC on Robinhood s payment-for-order-flow business model. Whatever the end result, Robinhood s mission to \u2018democratize finance  has fewer clients\u2014and employees\u2014along for the ride than it did a year ago.Infrastructure boom continuesLast week, I reported on two different infrastructure companies that raised venture funding: Streamlined and Minka.Ex-Chime engineers Boris de Souza and Zhuo Huang founded Streamlined, an Oakland-based startup that emerged from stealth with a total of $4 million in funding. A lot of B2B payments tech is built on top of B2C tech, such as Stripe, that was engineered to handle consumer card transactions, according to de Souza. But Streamlined is different, he claims, in that it has \u201ccustom built\u201d transaction infrastructure for B2B \u201cfrom the ground up.\u201d The company also touts that its infrastructure is designed to allow for faster merchant payouts and to \u201cdramatically simplify\u201d reconciliation, which he believes is one of the company s biggest differentiators. Greylock and SignalFire led the company s seed round.Image Credits: MinkaAlso, Bogota-based payments infrastructure startup Minka said it had secured $24 million in a funding round co-led by Tiger Global Management and Kaszek. In an interview, CEO and co-founder Domagoj Rozic described Minka as \u201can open network that aims to allow organizations such as banks and clearinghouses to \u2018publish  and move money in real time by exposing their \u2018closed, outdated core systems  to the web.\u201cThis in turn enables them to collect, send or exchange money in real time without the need for reconciliation and with almost no cost,\u201d Rozic told TechCrunch.These two rounds are proof that infrastructure is an area that is proving to be thus far resilient in the face of a global funding slowdown.Spend management \u2014 againFleet management company Motive has launched the Motive Card, marking the company s entry into the spend-management world, reported PYMNTS.\u201cWith fuel representing the second-largest operating cost for fleets, fuel discounts are more important than ever for driving profitability,\u201d Motive said in a news release issued on April 28.The company said the \u201czero fee\u201d card \u2014 which it claims is the first corporate card \u201cnatively integrated\u201d with a fleet-management platform \u2014 offers businesses substantial discounts at fuel providers, including Love s, TA, Petro Stopping Centers and TA Express, as well as savings on expenses such as tires and maintenance.\u201cMotive is unifying the management of financial and physical operations in one integrated platform,\u201d Shoaib Makani, co-founder and CEO of Motive, said in a statement.But Motive is not the only player in the space. In February, TechCrunch reported on Coast, which aims to help companies control fuel and fleet spending with its expense management software, and its $27.5 million Series A financing co-led by Accel and Insight Partners. Founded in late 2020 by Daniel Simon, Coast describes itself as the \u201cmodern financial services platform for the future of transportation.\u201d It compares itself to the likes of Ramp, Brex or Airbase in that it has developed an expense management software platform for fleet operators and their employees. To that end, and like the aforementioned spend-management companies, Coast has created a commercial charge card designed for the businesses that operate vehicle fleets, such as trucking companies, plumbers, HVAC businesses or last-mile delivery companies.Meanwhile, Rain raised $6 million in seed funding to provide corporate credit cards for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), reported The Block. Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round, which also included participation from Coinbase Ventures, Uniswap Labs and Terraform Labs. Founded by Farooq Malik and Charles Naut, the startup aims to tap into the growth of DAOs by providing them with a corporate card and expense management tools.Crypto, crypto and more cryptoLast week, I wrote about how teen-focused Copper raised a $29 million Series A led by Fiat Ventures. Since its launch last May, Copper has grown to have more than 800,000 users. That s up from 350,000 last October. While the company would not reveal its valuation or hard revenue figures, it did say that its revenue growth is in line with its user growth, which \u2014 as noted above \u2014 has more than doubled since October 2021.Seattle-based Copper offers features such as personalized debit cards, access to 50,000 ATMs and support for digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay. And now, it wants to move into giving teens a way to invest \u201cresponsibly\u201d in stocks, mutual funds and even crypto.Anita recently wrote about Step s efforts to also offer teens a way to invest in crypto. For more on the topic, listen to Alex Wilhelm and I riff about it on EquityPod here.Meanwhile, the biggest retirement plan provider in the United States, Fidelity, last week announced plans to offer individuals the opportunity to invest in bitcoin through their 401(k) retirement accounts later this year. With 20 million plan participants accounting for $2.7 trillion in assets, Fidelity just brought a somewhat controversial strategy into the mainstream.It s not surprising that Fidelity was the first tradfi asset management firm to stake out its territory in this space \u2014 the company has been ahead of its peers in launching digital asset products under the tenure of CEO Abigail Johnson. It launched its first crypto-related offering in 2018 when it began to hold digital assets in custody for institutional investors.The news marked a pivotal moment in the growing movement to expand access to alternative investments \u2014 a goal that can be seen as either laudable or risky, depending on whom you re asking. Anita digs in here (TechCrunch+ subscription required).Digital banking startup Cogni is joining the ranks of companies hopping on the crypto bandwagon. The mobile-based platform, founded in 2018 out of Barclays  accelerator program (which is operated by Techstars), launched with the intent to offer personalized banking products suited to the lifestyles of those in the 18-to-35 crowd, CEO and founder Archie Ravishankar told TechCrunch s Anita Ramaswamy. Now, Cogni has raised a $23 million funding round led by Hanwha Asset Management and CaplinFO with a new mandate \u2014 bringing Web 2.0 and web3 services together on one platform.Ondo, founded by two alums of Goldman Sachs  digital assets team, is capitalizing on crypto s capital markets by building what it calls a \u201cdecentralized investment bank.\u201d What that means is that Ondo acts as an intermediary between DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) that, like traditionally structured companies, need to raise money to fund their operations, and the investors who can provide them with that money. Last week, Ondo announced that it raised a $20 million Series A round, co-led by Pantera alongside Founders Fund. Coinbase Ventures, GoldenTree, Wintermute, Steel Perlot, Tiger Global and Flow Traders participated in the round as new strategic backers. More from Anita here.Fundings and other fintech newsI reported last week that PayPal is shuttering its San Francisco office as it evaluates its global office footprint. Multiple sources told me that the payments giant is closing its San Francisco office on 425 Market Street, which housed its Xoom business unit, by June 3. PayPal acquired Xoom, which is focused on online money transfer technology and services, in 2015. A person familiar with internal happenings at the company said the employees that worked out of that office will work virtually, with the ability to work from the company s headquarters office in San Jose. It is unclear how many employees are affected by the decision.\u00a0Self Financial, an Austin-based fintech that aims to make credit and savings accessible to U.S. consumers, announced that in addition to Equifax and TransUnion, it now also reports rent payments to Experian. Self claims that the move makes it \u201cthe first and only direct-to-consumer company to report rent to all three major credit bureaus.\u201d The announcement follows Self s February acquisition of rent and utility data furnishing company RentTrack and its consumer division LevelCredit. I covered the startup s $50 million raise last September.Kard announced last week that it raised a $23 million Series A round led by new investor Tiger Global, with participation from other new backers Fin Capital and s12f. Underscore VC, which led Kard s seed round in 2020, also participated in the latest funding. Kard s rewards-as-a-service API streamlines the card issuance process for issuers, allowing them to create a customized rewards program tailored to their particular customer base by choosing from Kard s set of merchant partnerships. The startup plans to use its new capital to expand its merchant network and to launch new reward and loyalty-related products in the coming quarters. Anita Ramaswamy gives us the story here.Ben Franklin once famously said that in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. But that doesn t make dealing with either particularly natural and easy. Tech is rushing in to fill that gap, and last week a Berlin-based startup called Taxfix, which has built a popular mobile assistant to address the former of these, is announcing a big round of funding to fuel its growth. It closed a Series D of $220 million at a valuation of over $1 billion, money that the startup will be using both to build in more products to extend its touch points with customers beyond annual use around tax time, and to expand to new markets beyond its current footprint of Germany, Spain and Italy. Ingrid Lunden gives us all the details here.S\u00e3o Paulo-based UME, a fintech specialized in \u201cbuy now pay later,\u201d has secured $10 million in funding, including $5.5 million in equity and $4.5 million in debt. Silicon Valley venture capital fund NFX and Brazilian VC firm Canary co-led the round. The startup plans to use the money to invest in a national expansion with the goal of allowing customers \u201cto shop at any retailer in Brazil, whether physical or online.\u201d UME says what differentiates it from other players in the space is its proprietary deep neural network (\u201cdeep learning\u201d). \u201cBringing high-end technology to analyze customers  behavior in the retail space allows us to create underwriting models based on proprietary data that grants better credit to more people\u201d, said founding partner Marco Cristo.\u00a0The company operates in the northern region of Brazil and has more than 70 retailers in its network, adding up to more than 350 stores. At the end of 2021, the startup had performed over 100,000 transactions and granted credit to more than 45,000 customers.QuotaPath \u2014 which has developed a commission-tracking solution for sales and revenue teams \u2014 raised a $41 million Series B led by Tribe Capital with participation from Insight Partners and others. The funding comes nine months after its $21.3 million Series A round. During that time, the startup says it has tripled its revenue and doubled its team.OneVest raised $5 million CAD in seed funding and the support of fintech-focused investors like Luge Capital and National Bank s NAventures to accelerate the growth of its wealth management offering. More here.Trust, a Los Angeles, Cakifornia-based \u201cgrowth network\u201d for emerging brands founded by a group of Snap alums, secured $30 million in debt and equity funding. That included $25 million in debt from Upper90 and $5 million in equity from existing and new investors, including Sapphire Sport and Michael Vaughan (Venmo s former COO). Christine Hall covered the startup s $9 million raise last August.Carbon Collective, an online investment advisor \u201c100% focused\u201d on solving climate change, announced an oversubscribed seed round at $2.2 million, featuring Powerhouse Ventures, HyperGuap and Elevation Ventures. Founded in 2020, Carbon Collective has a B2C robo investment offering, a B2B Green 401(k) and claims to have compiled \u201cthe most comprehensive list of climate solution stocks in its 2022 Climate Index.That s it for this week.

        "title": "Slice and dice it all you want, that s a seed round",
        "text": "Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.There s a clash happening in the early-stage market.In one world, late-stage investors are reacting to tech stonk corrections by clamoring toward the early-stage investment world, forcing seed investors to go even earlier to defend ownership and potential returns. This trend was underscored by firms like Andreessen Horowitz launching a pre-seed program months after launching a $400 million seed fund. Even more, Techstars, an accelerator literally launched to help startups get off the ground, debuted a fund to back companies that are too early for its traditional programming.While all that is going on, early-stage investors are enduring a valuation correction and portfolio markdowns. Some are admitting that they re telling portfolio companies to refocus on cash conservation, profitability and discipline, not just growth.Let s pretend these two vastly different worlds are in the same universe: Early-stage investors are getting more disciplined and cash rich, but at the same time, the earliest investors are going earlier. Investors are pushing founders to be lean but also green, but at the same time, offering them $10,000 to take PTO for a week and try their hand at entrepreneurship. Growth, gross margin and burn are the new top priorities for CEOs, but at the same time, venture capitalists are clamoring to offer more funds, earlier, in newly invented subcategories of early-stage investment.It s a lot happening at once, and makes me worry about the race to the bottom \u2014 or race to the earliest stage \u2014 and its consequences. For more thoughts, read my TechCrunch+ piece: \u201cIf the earliest investors keep going earlier, what will happen?\u201dIn this newsletter, we ll talk about news that has to do with Elon Musk, and news that has nothing to do with Elon Musk. As always, you can support me by forwarding this newsletter to a friend, following me on Twitter or subscribing to my personal blog.Let s talk about Elon MuskAs I m sure many of you know all too well, Elon Musk s $44 billion dollar bid for Twitter was accepted this week, marking a massive moment in tech history and a looming return to the private markets for a fundamental social media platform. We wrote up the entire timeline of Musk s acquisition, from tweet to close, but just know the saga is nowhere near done \u2014 the deal is yet to officially close.Here s why it s important: I mean, for once this format doesn t work because there s way too many angles for why Musk s buy of Twitter is important. Instead, I ll just bullet list some specific angles that TechCrunch dug into.Musk sells $8.5 billion worth of Tesla sharesBring on the Twitter mafiaJack Dorsey set to pocket $978M if Elon Musk s Twitter acquisition closes\u00a0You know damn well that Trump is coming back to Twitter\u00a0Elon Musk s Twitter deal includes a $1 billion termination fee on both sidesAnd a special Equity Wednesday episode with Alex and Amanda: Yes, we re talking about Elon.And finally, I ll just remind you all that Twitter, in its earnings this week, said that it has overcounted its users over the past 3 years. By 1.9 million accounts. Jeez. It s a bad look for Twitter, but also bad news for advertisers \u2014 a revenue stream that the platform is very dependent on. As Sarah Perez put it, \u201cfor a company as dependent on advertising revenues as Twitter currently is, it s a wonder why they would agree to a deal that puts a free speech absolutist in charge.\u201dImage Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunchOk, now let s not talk about Elon Musk for the rest of the newsletterYes, we re at that point of the [insert high\u2013profile news cycle] story. First, there are the leaks and scoops. Then there are the slightly hedged thought pieces. Then, there is the Major Confirmation. Then, there are the straight-up savage threads and op-eds, sprinkled with more leaks, more scoops and key details. And finally, the stories that want to provide brief respite from the aforementioned madness. Let s embrace this last stage!The deal of the week, that may have snuck under your radar, is that Robinhood is laying off 9% of full-time staff. Here s why it s important: Robinhood announced its layoffs just days before Q1 2022 earnings, and after its seen its value erode in the public markets. The move thus seems defensive, and the company s attempt at proving that it s en route to becoming a more efficient and growth-oriented financial institution. Also in fintech news, PayPal is shuttering its San Francisco office.Things are getting tense:Raising a Series A in a market of mixed messagesNetflix layoffs hit Tudum, its editorial arm, just five months after launchBetter.com s third round of layoffs in five months believed to impact over 1K employees\u00a0January Ventures  new fund will help young startups navigate this \u2018Darwinian moment Image Credits: Orla (opens in a new window) / Getty ImagesAcross the weekSnag tickets for next month s event: TechCrunch Mobility, a two-day hybrid conference featuring top investors, founders and thought leaders of the automotive industry.If you missed last week s newsletter, check it out: \u201cDeal terms feel like dart boards these days.\u201dBig shout out to my colleague, Mary Ann, on the launch of her fintech newsletter \u201cThe Interchange.\u201d Subscribe so you can flex early-adopter status on the industry s new can t miss weekly column.Seen on TechCrunchHow Lydia wants to make payments more personal and socialDoes it smell like teen spirit, or teen bankruptcy?Airbnb commits to fully remote workplace: \u2018Live and work anywhere AppDynamics founder s Midas touch strikes again as Harness valuation hits $3.7BSnap announces a mini drone called PixySeen on TechCrunch+How to get into Y Combinator, according to YC s Dalton CaldwellPlease don t YOLO your 401(k) into shitcoinsHaving some crypto in your 401(k) is neither irrational nor exuberantWhy Latin America s freight-forwarding opportunity is still attracting capitalCharged with billions in capital, meet the 9 startups developing tomorrow s batteries todayUntil next time,N",

        "title": "DeltaX wants to digitize the Andean region s trucking sector",
        "text": "Transportation startup DeltaX is accelerating its plans to digitize the trucking industry in its native Bolivia and beyond thanks to a recent $1 million seed round.DeltaX operates in the same space as Convoy, Loadsmart and Sennder \u2013 freight forwarding (plainly, helping companies move goods from point A to point B). But the startup focuses on a region of Latin America where trucking is still in dire need of a digital transformation, unlike other countries where this transition has already begun and accelerated amid the pandemic.\u201cWe are working to solve a huge logistics problem in the Andean region,\u201d DeltaX CEO Luis Fernando Ortiz said. \u201cOver-the-road transportation in this economic zone is inefficient and expensive, which has enormous implications for the competitiveness of our countries and the well-being of our truck drivers.\u201dWhy Latin America s freight-forwarding opportunity is still attracting capitalMillions of tons of cargo are transported each year via the Pan-American Highway and its branches across Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Paraguay. The cargo includes commodities, such as minerals from the Lithium Triangle and beyond; grain, fruit and vegetables, as well as containerized imports. But the process is deficient, and it is drivers who pay the toll.There are around 1 million truck drivers in the region, most of them independent, Ortiz said. In its current form, this fragmentation has many downsides, which DeltaX is hoping to address through technology.There are several layers to DeltaX s activities: It facilitates communication between parties, automates cargo tracking and reporting, and adds visibility to shipment documentation, with upcoming elements of fintech and machine learning.\u201cEveryone in our sector follows this model, but we are going to be the first ones to apply it to our region,\u201d Ortiz said.Adapting to Latin AmericaDigitization is undeniably a shared need around the world for logistics, a sector that until recently largely operated on phone calls, printouts and faxes. But while this has started to change in many countries, Bolivia still lagged behind.Ortiz knew this problem firsthand: He used to work for the Chilean port of Arica, a major hub for the region. There, he co-founded a club for truck drivers, most of whom came from neighboring countries and needed more support. This is how he knows that they typically spend 25 days in a row on the road away from their families \u2014 and the harm that a lack of work predictability causes to their quality of life.Thanks to a Fulbright scholarship, Ortiz went on to study in the U.S., obtaining a master s degree in Business Administration from Babson and an M.A. of Public Administration from Harvard. Now that he has moved back to Bolivia, both are proving relevant to his new endeavor, where business acumen matters perhaps just as much as an understanding of regulation and of the social context of the drivers.Understanding the needs of drivers has deeply shaped DeltaX s technology. When it first launched in February 2020, it was a mobile application for truck drivers. Mobile still plays a key role in its strategy, as does WhatsApp, with bots providing answers to frequent questions on the go.Better serving the 1,300 drivers affiliated with DeltaX is also why the startup is planning to add an embedded fintech element to its platform, as is now common among Latin American startups. It would take the form of a microcredit lending program for working capital \u2013 providing advances on upcoming revenue.\u201cTruck drivers are underbanked because their income isn t stable; that s why the fintech side is important to us,\u201d Ortiz said.DeltaX also hopes that algorithms will be able to improve its prediction abilities, and therefore the working conditions of drivers. Instead of having to pay intermediaries and not being sure they ll secure work, Ortiz explained, \u201cA driver can say: I m staying home this weekend because I know I have a journey planned for Monday.\u201dHiring the data scientists who can make this happen is one of the ways DeltaX plans to use the proceeds of its seed round. With a current team of 23, it also plans to add UX experts, software engineers and product managers to keep on improving its platform.Neighbors helping neighborsDeltaX s seed round was backed by several funds from the U.S. and Latin America: Magma Partners, out of Chile, which led the round; Duro Ventures, from California; 99 Startups, from Mexico; and Cibersons, from Paraguay. Bolivian angel network SC Angeles, which Ortiz co-founded, also participated.While these names carry quite a bit of weight, as does the fact that DeltaX participated in the Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs Accelerator, the profile of some of its individual backers is also worth noting. Indeed, several of them have high-level roles in Latin America s transportation sector, including two startup founders: Nowports CEO Alfonso de los Rios and Nuvocargo CEO Deepak Chhugani.Ortiz said that DeltaX is complementary to these startups because of its geographic focus and the subverticals it is concentrating on. A key aspect is its exclusive focus on over-the-ground transportation, which is tied to a sore point in Bolivia s history: The country is landlocked, having lost access to the sea in 1884 after a war with Chile.DeltaX s fundraising event is an important milestone for Bolivia s startup scene: It is one of the country s largest venture capital rounds to date. This shows that the ecosystem is still nascent, but also confirms the progress it has been making over the last few years.Recent exits include NetComidas  acquisition by PedidosYa\u00a0and Venezuelan super app company Yummy buying up Yaigo.But Bolivia isn t just fodder for expansion-oriented M&As: It also has startups with regional ambitions, such as TuGerente and Ultra. DeltaX is one of these; in the coming months, it plans to open offices in neighboring countries to expand its operations, starting with Peru.In the longer term, DeltaX hopes to further expand to Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Paraguay, Ortiz told TechCrunch. Will there be more consolidation in Latin America s transportation sector in the meantime? It will be interesting to watch.",

After leaving his job at Careem, Adil Nisar founded a company that sources, manufacturers and distributes lights in Pakistan and experienced those challenges firsthand. So he teamed up with Raza Kazmi, the former group CFO of one of Pakistan s largest distribution houses, to found Oware, a network of connected warehouses that let businesses track and manage their shipments from a single portal.Today the company announced it has raised $3.3 million pre-seed funding from investors including Flexport Fund, Ratio Ventures, Seedstars International Ventures, Sketchnote Partners, The Osiris Group, Swiss Founders Fund, Reflect Ventures, +92 Ventures and Walled City Co.Nisar told TechCrunch that while starting novo, his biggest challenge as a small business owner was finding a reliable fulfillment partner and managing upfront capital costs related to warehousing.\u00a0The Oware Eye Customer Portal. Image Credits: OwareOware is meant to provide businesses with an affordable and scalable solution to traditional warehouse networks, while ensuring timely deliveries to end customers. Most of its customers are B2B market and retail companies that are looking for backend warehousing and transportation to their last distribution point or dark store.Oware currently has 18 warehouses in five cities in Pakistan, with a total space of 500,000 square feet. Part of Oware s funding will be used to increase its coverage, which the company says can already provide same-day delivery to 75% of the population and next-day delivery to 85%.The company rents its warehouse space and works with third-party logistics providers. Oware s clients can quickly start their operations from any of its locations, picking the ones that are closest to their end customers. Oware s partners handles almost everything they need for deliveries, including picking, packing and shipping.

The startup makes electric motorbikes with key components that it designs and produces domestically to reduce costs and improve performance. Today, Dat Bike announced it has raised a $5.3 million Series A led by Jungle Ventures, with participation from Wavemaker Partners.Both are returning investors. Jungle Ventures led Dat Bike s seed round a year ago, when TechCrunch first profiled the company. The latest funding brings Dat Bike s total to $10 million raised since it was founded in 2019 by Son Nguyen.Dat Bike is recognized by the Vietnam Ministry of Transportation as the first domestically made electric bike. Nguyen said that Dat Bike uses vertical integration instead of relying on third-party imported electric drivetrains and parts because that keeps costs down while improving quality. Most of the parts on Dat Bike s vehicles are designed by the company and 80% of its suppliers are located in Vietnam. It also uses a direct-to-consumer distribution model, pushing prices down lower.Part of the funding will be invested in its technology. Nguyen explained that the three most important parts of an electric bike are its battery, motor and controller. Right now, Dat Bike owns technology for its battery packaging and controller. With its new capital, it will be able to invest in its engine technology. Nguyen added that the company will also upgrade its mobile app, adding new features and shortening the feedback loop on its error reporting feature.One major thing the company had to address was consumer concerns about the performance of e-bikes compared to their gasoline counterparts. The company says its first product line, the Weaver, displayed three times the performance (5 kW versus 1.5 kW) and two times the range of (100 km versus 50 km) of most competing electric bikes. Dat Bike s second model, the Weaver 200, was launched last year with higher performance, or a range of 200 km and 6 kW power. It also reduced charging time from 1 hour for 100 km to 2.5 hours for its full 200 km charge.\u201cWe aim to develop a new product every year and research for faster charging,\u201d Nguyen said.Dat Bike currently has two stores in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, and its bikes can be ordered online, too. Part of the funding will be used to expand its offline-to-online model into more large cities, including Thai Nguyen, Bac Ninh, Hai Phong, Hai Duong, Ha Long, Vinh, Quy Nhon, Nha Trang, Danang, Can Tho and Vung Tau.Steer s Anuja Sonalker explains the benefits of chasing the less glitzy side of autonomy",

        "text": "Sumutasu, a Tokyo-based proptech startup that offers a direct online real estate purchase service, has secured $8.2 million in equity and $1.6 million in debt. The company has raised a total of $16 million since its 2018 inception. \u00a0Takahiro Sumi (CEO) and Tomoya Ito (COO) co-founded Sumutasu four years ago to streamline the buying and selling of residential real estate.In Japan, where the real estate market is fragmented, homeowners have faced uncertain selling prices riddled with brokerage fees and an average selling period of between four and eight months, Ito said. Those factors have led to a low percentage of existing homes in circulation in Japan \u2014 around 15% compared to the 80% typically seen in countries like the U.S. and the U.K., per the 2020 report of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT). Sumutasu says its platform enables users to access a fair house valuation in an hour.\u00a0Sumutasu has adopted an iBuyer model \u2014 meaning it buys houses directly from homeowners, renovates them at scale, then resells them to buyers. While the U.S. and Europe have a more competitive iBuyer market with Opendoor, Zillow, Offerpad and Redfin, Japan has a nascent iBuyer industry, according to the company.\u201cThe business model is similar in the way that it is an arbitrage model where the difference between the purchase price and the sales price is the profit,\u201d Ito told TechCrunch. \u201cThe difference is that we purchase from the seller at a discount from the market price. The reason we are able to purchase at a discount is that we offer sellers the value of being able to sell at their own time and hassle-free.\u201d\u00a0 Additionally, unlike the iBuyers that charge service fees, Sumutasu does not charge a commission or processing fee because the transaction is conducted directly with the seller \u2014 without an agent in between, Ito said in an interview. When purchasing an existing house in Japan, brokerage fees usually amount to about 3% of the property price, Ito added.\u00a0The Japanese real estate tech startup operates its service in Tokyo but plans to take it to more areas like Osaka and Nagoya. With the latest funding, the company plans to continue to buy more houses, and launch its mortgage brokering service next year, aiming to increase sales five-fold compared to 2021. It also intends to expand its headcount.\u00a0Sumutasu has purchased approximately 100 properties and currently maintains 30 property listings due to smooth progression of sales, Ito told TechCrunch. The company is partnered with more than 20 banks and remodeling companies.\u00a0Existing backer World Innovation Lab (WiL) and new investor Mobile Internet Capital co-led the Series B, with participation from other new investors Mercuria Investment, Carta Ventures and Kiraboshi Capital. Japan Finance Corporation led the debt financing.\u201cDespite the iBuyer business having a huge potential in terms of the market size, we haven t seen this business model in Japan for a long time due to it being financially intensive,\u201d said partner of World Innovation Lab Toshimichi Namba. \u201cWe are confident that they [Sumutasu] can leverage this less competitive landscape to further fuel their growth.\u201d\u00a0The company has a team of 30 people.\u00a0What does Zillow s exit tell us about the health of the iBuying market?Opendoor raises $300M on a $3.8B valuation for its home marketplace",

        "text": "Singapore s Neuron Mobility has raised a $43.5 million Series B round, bringing its total capital investment to $77.7 million. The shared micromobility company with a presence in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, the U.K. and Canada will use the funds to invest in its proprietary technology and double down in existing markets, focusing on cities that want an exclusive or semi-exclusive relationship with operators, according to Zachary Wang, Neuron s co-founder and CEO.\u201cOur view is the market should be regulated with a limited number of operators,\u201d Wang told TechCrunch. \u201cThat s the only way to run both a sustainable business as well as a responsible service in a city in the long run.\u201dSince its founding in 2016, Neuron has expanded internationally to 26 cities, with sizable market dominance in Australia, where the operator can be found on the streets of every capital city in the country. While Neuron doesn t quite have the scale of competitors like Lime, Bird and Tier, Wang said Neuron s expansion strategy is not based on putting scooters on the ground everywhere.\u201cWe are taking a global ambition and global view, but we are growing in a unique Neuron way that focuses on highly regulated markets and continues to build and invest into a growing portfolio of cities with long-term contracts and limited competition,\u201d said Wang, noting that chasing \u201cfree-for-all\u201d cities that have allowed multiple operators to dump vehicles on the roads has not led to profitability \u2014 or public acceptance of micromobility.Neuron isn t the only micromobility company that is pursuing limited vendor permits and a slower, more organic growth plan. Spin, which was recently acquired by Tier, last year declared its intent to only go after more exclusive city partnerships, and Veo says it s been able to achieve favorable unit economics and even profitability by cultivating a more patient and sustainable business model.Neuron has also touted its commitment to designing and manufacturing its own scooters, rather than purchasing them off the shelf. Nowadays, most micromobility players design their own scooters and work with partners like Segway and Okai to manufacture.\u201cWe have always been taking the more painful path of developing upstream technologies, hardware, software, IoT,\u201d said Wang. \u201cIt would have been much easier to buy that all from somebody else, but we deliberately took that path and now we re seeing the fruits of our labors.\u201dLast November, Neuron announced its in-house scooter ADAS technology, which uses high-accuracy location tech and rapid geofence detection in order to detect and correct unsafe riding behavior, like aggressive swerving, skidding, curb jumping, tandem riding and sidewalk riding. The company is currently trialing this tech, what Neuron is calling its new \u201ce-scooter brain,\u201d on 1,500 scooters in Australia, Canada and the U.K.The latest investment will help Neuron roll out the \u201cbrain\u201d in more cities at a quicker scale, said Wang.Neuron s Series B was co-led by GSR Ventures and Square Peg, with participation from Singapore s EDBI.Correction: A previous version of this article stated Neuron has launched in 22 cities.",

        "text": "Shared micromobility company Voi is deploying e-scooters in Oslo, Norway with Drover AI s computer vision tech that can identify whether a scooter is on the pavement, road or cycle lane in order to help prevent sidewalk riding.As the micromobility industry consolidates around a few key players and cities become more discerning about which operators they allow on their streets, operators are looking for ways to appear more attractive to cities. If there s one thing cities seem to hate more than scooters riding on sidewalks, it s taking ownership for why scooter riders are on sidewalks in the first place and responding with dedicated bike lanes. As a result, it operators like Voi have turned to\u00a0advanced rider assistance systems to give them a good reputation.And it appears to be working.Voi, which has been operating in Oslo for over two years, recently had its tender extended another year, alongside Tier and Bolt (Bolt is another one of Drover s customers, as well as Spin, Beam, Helbiz and Fenix). The inclusion of Drover s tech was one of the reasons Voi s Safety & Parking score on its application ranked the highest out of the 12 companies that participated, according to someone familiar with the matter.Out of the 2,000 scooters the Swedish startup is deploying in Oslo, hundreds with be equipped with Drover s PathPilot AI technology over the next few months. Drover s tech is capable not only of detecting when a rider is on the sidewalk or parking a scooter inappropriately, but it can also alert the rider of their transgressions and even slow them to a stop. These more involved capabilities are at the discretion of the operator and the city, and Voi has not yet clarified how or if it will step in should a rider be misbehaving.This isn t Voi s first time deploying camera-based technology to prevent scooters riding or parking on sidewalks. Last summer, Voi launched a pilot in the U.K. with Dublin-based Luna that investigates how smart AI cameras could help better enable scooter parking, prevent sidewalk riding and avoid potential hazards. The Drover partnership is similar, although it will also help improve geofencing to govern how and where scooters are ridden and parked, and it will be done at scale, a Voi spokesperson told TechCrunch.Voi also intends to use its collaboration with Drover to build a record of where and how scooters are being ridden in Oslo. PathPilot will automatically deliver insights on fleet use or rider behavior, which Voi says it can share with Oslo City Council to help improve the service by optimizing locations of e-scooters or recognizing fallen scooters to be picked up by Voi workers, said the company.Learn the keys to unlocking micromobility profits at TC Sessions: Mobility 2022",

        "text": "This is an interesting day when we see two of China s major robotaxi foes come together, offering a clue to how the industry is evolving in the country.WeRide.ai and Pony.ai, which both operate out of China s southern metropolis Guangzhou and California, have participated in OnTime s one billion yuan ($153 million) Series A funding round, according to an announcement from ride-hailing company OnTime on Tuesday.As autonomous driving technology and regulations advance rapidly in China, ride-hailing platforms start looking for solutions to cut labor costs. On the other hand, robotaxi startups also want help from car-hailing services to reach the masses.Financing from the round came from a mix of private and public funds in China and overseas. State-backed Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC), the parent company of OnTime and one of the largest automakers in China, led the round. Investors other than WeRide and Pony include Japan s SPARX, Singapore s Pilgrim Partners Asia, as well as government-affiliated funds Guangzhou Industrial Investment and Capital Operation, Lingnan Commerce and Trade Tourism, and Guangzhou Industrial Control.OnTime is the ride-hailing service introduced by GAC in 2019 as one of the newcomers competing with incumbent Didi, many of which are either operated by auto OEMs or are close to one.WeRide has been known to be an ally of GAC, which infused it with an undisclosed amount of strategic investment last December. The duo has been working to build a fleet of tens of thousands of robotaxis, with GAC supplying vehicles compatible with WeRide s driving solutions. WeRide and OnTime have already integrated their systems and together offered a trial ride to the public at Guangzhou Auto Show last year.The seemingly close ties between WeRide and GAC make Pony s involvement in OnTime s new funding round all the more intriguing. For GAC, it s probably a good idea to have more than one autonomous solution provider to encourage competition. Indeed, GAC has other major corporate allies, including Tencent, which helped kick off OnTime, as well as Huawei and Didi, which said last year would be helping GAC develop autonomous driving tech among other smart auto capabilities.For Pony, piggy-backing off a major carmaker can potentially bring a steady stream of business and push for the adoption of its tech. Toyota, an investor in Pony, is considered Pony s close partner, but the Japanese auto giant probably doesn t enjoy the same breadth of resources as GAC in China, where public transportation is largely owned by the government.Jiang Hua, CEO of OnTime, has this to say about China s robotaxi space in a statement: \u201cIn the last stage, the industry was focused on improving computing algorithms and hardware capabilities. As technology develops, the focus has turned to the operation of autonomous driving. Robotaxis have to operate through ride-hailing platforms if they want to become a real service, which is why two of the world s leading autonomous driving companies chose to back OnTime.\u201dWith the proceeds, OnTime says it will be monetizing robotaxis at a faster pace and creating a vehicle-as-a-service platform for the industry in a bid to become a \u201cglobal leader in autonomous driving operations.\u201d",

        "title": "How Bounce beat pandemic disruption and bagged a16z to lead its Series A",
        "text": "Bounce, a San Francisco-based startup that s spent over three years building up a business which layers a number of convenience-focused services, starting with luggage storage and package acceptance, atop a network of independent retailers and other businesses located in cities around the world, is looking to bounce back in a big way from the impact of the pandemic.The 2020 global freeze on leisure travel put a temporary pause on demand for short term luggage storage. More people working from home because of COVID-19 likely also temporarily reduced demand for third party package acceptance services \u2014 since more people were in to receive deliveries themselves.Nonetheless, Bounce claims it was able to continue growing its business during the pandemic \u2014 saying it paid out more than one million dollars to local businesses during the pandemic in spite of COVID-19 s impact. It s now anticipating a demand boom for its services as travellers jet off again and offices reopen to regular staff.Currently, it s serving \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of customers per month \u2014 with its largest markets being London, New York, and Paris \u2014\u00a0but by late summer it expects to have grown monthly users to \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d.That s quite the change from two years ago.\u00a0Co-founder and CEO Cody Candee admits business \u201ccompletely froze\u201d for the first three months of the pandemic. But by summer 2020 there was a temporary unlocking as parts of Europe reopened to tourism \u2014 so Bounce focused its efforts on markets like Croatia at that point.He explains that it then kept retargeting different markets and regions as the impact of the virus fluctuated, seeking out pockets of opportunity as and where they appeared, such as switching focus from Europe to Australia in fall 2020 or targeting effort at non urban areas and domestic travel hotspots (\u201cfrom Brighton to Myrtle Beach, to Hawaii\u201d, is his concise summary).The upshot was Bounce was able to grow revenue 38x in 2021, per Candee \u2014 reaching \u201cmillions\u201d in revenue, and expanding its partner network to 40 countries. Now almost half (45%) of its revenue comes from outside the U.S., he adds.\u201cWe basically just chased the opportunity wherever it was,\u201d he tells TechCrunch, summing up how Bounce tackled the last two years of pandemic disruption. \u201cAll the while, we kept shipping pieces of content to our website while expanding our store network knowing it may not have much effect now but once the pandemic subsided, far more customers would discover us and we d have far more locations to serve these customers. It was a gamble and not easy but now we can say it paid off! We re seeing explosive growth with the recovery of the pandemic all around the world.\u201dTo fuel the expected boom in growth, Bounce is announcing close of a $12 million Series A round of funding, led by Andreesen Horowitz. Other investors participating include General Catalyst, who led a seed round of funding, announced back in December 2021.Commenting on the Series A in a statement, Andrew Chen, general partner at a16z, said:\u00a0\u201cBounce has shown tremendous resilience throughout the pandemic, continuing to not only build but also grow. By aggregating all different types of SMB supply \u2014 from hotels to post offices to bike rental shops \u2014 they ve been able to establish a strong network that they can continue to grow and offer more services on top of.\u201d\u00a0The new funding will go on fast scaling in Europe \u2014 where key markets it s targeting include Italy, France, and the UK. (Bounce also established a European HQ in Lisbon, Portugal, last year to prep for its regional growth push.)The Series A money will also be put towards expanding the number of services it offers. Although it s not yet disclosing what additional services are coming down the pipe.\u201cBounce has a long list of other services we plan to introduce however we don t yet have a public roadmap of new services,\u201d says Candee when asked what else it wants to offer with the help of a growing network of small businesses partners who receive a revenue share for their part in providing services to Bounce users.The startup has more than 7,000 locations signed up to offer Bounce services at this stage. All locations offer luggage storage \u2014 but only a subset (around 2,000) do package acceptance.In terms of coverage spread, London currently leads as the city where Bounce has the most partners (200); followed by 170 in Paris, and \u201cdozens\u201d more apiece in other European cities such as Madrid, Rome, Budapest and Dubrovnik.\u00a0The revenue split for these partners is \u201ctypically\u201d 50-50, per Candee, who confirms that Bounce covers \u201call fees\u201d for partners \u2014 e.g. payment processing, customer acquisition, marketing signage (such as the below example displayed outside a shop).Bounce users can pay-per-item (90% of its customers currently do that). But it also offers a subscription option for package acceptance customers and appears to have big plans on that front, with Candee noting that it will be investing more in subscription offerings later this year.Bounce signage for luggage storage outside a shop. Image Credits: BounceThe second of Bounce s two current service offerings \u2014 package acceptance \u2014 launched in March last year.\u201cThe package service was a top customer request, particularly in cities like New York,\u201d says Candee. \u201cThis is especially useful to them compared to PO Boxes or Amazon lockers because it provides a single nearby location where the customer can get all their packages. Customers don t want to go to one place for Amazon packages, one place for UPS, one place for FedEx. Customers like having a dedicated address they can give out and collect all their parcels from.\u201dHe says the goal is, in five years  time, people will \u201cwalk down the street and see the Bounce logo and know they can do these 10 different services there\u201d.And while Bounce isn t the only startup trying to simplify luggage storage globally (see the likes of Vertoe), Candee has for years emphasized a wider \u201cplatform\u201d vision. Back in 2018 he told us about \u201cbroader use cases\u201d which could plug into Bounce s network of bricks-and-mortar locations \u2014 such as having courier services transporting items between different partner locations in order that a user could, for example, drop off clothes at a convenient location for them and have them moved to the dry cleaner and returned back to where they want to pick them back up once the clothes are clean.Candee also describes Bounce s mission as being to build \u201cthe biggest retail chain in the world without owning any stores\u201d \u2014 comparing it to Airbnb vs hotels.\u201cWhen the pandemic hit and small businesses lost all of their revenue, we asked them how we could best support them and the resounding answer was finding new ways to drive revenue,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cOur goal is to win the hearts of small businesses around the world, helping them grow and diversify their businesses and bringing the power of scalable tech to them. SMB s are typically underserved by the technology industry yet they fuel so much of the economy \u2014 we re excited to be a key player in driving a new way of commerce to all different types of small businesses around the world.\u201dBounce talks in term of a \u201cBounceBack Program\u201d \u2014 aka, a \u201cpledge\u201d to support small business to \u201c\u2018bounce back  as we continue to climb out of the pandemic\u201d, as its marketing puts it. And earlier this month it said it would be paying out $3M to its partners \u201cover the next few months\u201d via this program.\u201cWith BounceBack, we are, in certain cases, offering guaranteed revenue to stores for this period. We re also investing far more in local marketing,\u201d says Candee of this program.It also recently announced a BouncePlus Program for partners who \u201cgo the extra mile to provide the best Bounce experience possible\u201d \u2014 saying that would further dial up benefits via extras such as weekly payouts, tipping, free signage, a dedicated account manager and a featured presence on the Bounce platform.Bounce says the requirements for getting BouncePlus perks are to: Maintain a high review score; have ~zero \u201cdrops\u201d (which means \u201cstore hours are up to date and customers always get served\u201d); and that all bags stored must go through the Bounce platform (\u201cproviding the highest levels of bag safekeeping\u201d).Depending on how much extra work is actually involved in meeting those requirements, being featured on Bounce s platform offers the promise of \u2018free  advertising for the SMEs \u2014 which may be offering highly relevant services of their own to Bounce s convenience-minded and/or tourist users, from bike rental or accommodation to selling ice cream and souvenirs, or indeed package sending services \u2014 giving independent businesses an incentive to drive Bounce s quality of service in order to get the best chance of boosting footfall and winning extra business on top of whatever it directly pays them for their work.With the right mix of locations signed up, the incentives do therefore look very well aligned.Although the demands of convenience mean Bounce needs partners in certain locations of relevance to users, such as key transport hubs, regardless of whether the services they offer are likely to be of interest to its users \u2014 hence its partners can include businesses such as hairdressers and even offices as well as hotels and tourist-targeting retail outlets.The original idea for Bounce came to Candee back in 2014, although he didn t start work on the startup until January 2018 \u2014 going on take take in $1.2M in early funding later that year.He says the idea came to him ahead of a Friday post-work Happy Hour event \u2014 when someone had said he would join but needed to go home first to drop off a bag to avoid carrying it around all night and Candee says it struck him that \u201cpeople shouldn t plan their days around their things\u201d.\u201cThat s when I thought \u2014 wow, this is such a silly problem that so many people have, there should definitely be another way,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe original idea was more of a vision: Cloud storage for the physical world \u2014 this idea that you could summon your things away from you and back to you, involving storage points around the city as well as delivery drivers moving your bags.\u201dThe platform itself launched on Product Hunt in February 2019, ahead of the pandemic. And by November 2021 Bounce was getting 10,000+ new customers storing luggage every month, per Candee.\u201cThe typical Bounce user for luggage storage is 24-35 years old though it s pretty broad including anyone who is traveling or going to events,\u201d he says now, adding: \u201cWe ve seen a large uptick in usage around sporting events, concerts, etc as the pandemic subsides and everyone is eager to get out. Travel is also exploding right now.\u201dBounce raises $1.2M to tap local retailers for short-term storageTravel booking app Hopper upgrades its valuation to $5B on secondary sale",

        "title": "Lucid Green raises $10 million to bring smart UPC codes to cannabis",
        "text": "Cannabis companies face unprecedented headwinds. Yet these companies are building businesses in a tough market plagued by myriad challenges, from banking prohibitions to ever-changing regulations. One such startup, Lucid Green, has a solution to a growing labeling problem, and raised a $10 million Series B led by Gron Ventures with participation from Gotham Green Partners.The company s intelligent UPC aims to reduce cost and increase transparency in all parts of the supply chain, from growers to brands to retailers to consumers.With Lucid Green s system, aptly called LucidID, products use one barcode from seed to consumer. Cultivators and brands can use this barcode to upload and access test results and compliance certifications. In addition, retailers can use it for real-time inventory management and building loyalty programs with shoppers. Because this happens with one label, Lucid Green says this system eliminates the tedious process of affixing new labels to product packaging.\u201cSometimes I feel like Henry Ford with the first Model T cars, where everybody s used to horses and saddles,\u201d Larry Levy, CEO and co-founder of Lucid Green, tells me. He s speaking to the challenges of bringing this product to market, saying that everyone was used to transporting goods with horses, and with the advent of the car came the need for the infrastructure to support it. He feels the same thing is happening in cannabis right now.Legal cannabis is highly regulated and requires numerous checks along the route to the consumer. The retailer or dispensary is often saddled with extra work around affixing specific labels to different products as regulations change, increasing labor costs and reducing revenues. Lucid Green claims its data suggests the LucidID system can save retailers up $10,000 a month.Other companies offer similar solutions around QR codes but lack the comprehensive benefits found with LucidID. For example, some brands use QR codes to give consumers more information. Others use QR codes for inventory tracking. Lucid Green says the closest competitor comes from pharmaceutical companies, though most stop short of letting consumers access the information available to pharmacies.The project started from the consumer s point of view. \u201cThe idea was to put all the [testing and strain information] in a QR code that leads to rich information to allow people to have a better experience,\u201d Levy said. \u201cAbout 18 months ago in the California market, regulators kept layering on more regulations\u2026and started asking the brands to put on unique codes.\u201d These codes carry critical regulatory testing results and often require workers to put a label on each product.\u201cThis was a huge driver for us, to say, \u2018Hey, we re already putting this code on the pack, so why don t you, the supply chain, just use it, too .\u201dWilder Ramsey from Gron Ventures led the Series A round. He told TechCrunch that talking to retailers led him to invest in Lucid Green. He says they re desperate for this solution, with one of the largest LA dispensaries throwing in and only accepting new products if it sports a LucidID label.\u201cAnd that was a real wake-up call that this issue had reached a boiling point,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cThere are so many freaking SKUs. You have a strain component and form factor component. You have a size component and vape cartridges that are available in half-gram or full-cart sizes. Then the consumer is thinking, \u2018Well, am I buying Sativa or Indica?  This is not like a retailer stocking a six-pack or 12-pack of Coke. And it s not like Diet Coke or regular Coke. It s, like, we ve got 5,000 products.\u201d\u201cI don t know, maybe Larry has a masochistic streak or something,\u201d Ramsey says, laughing after listing the boxes Larry checks. \u201cHe s a serial founder, and we ve seen the advantages of that time and time again. He s been at this problem as long, if not longer, than anyone else. And he has the ear of brands and retailers.\u201d Ramsey says this is critical when creating a two-sided marketplace like what Lucid Green is creating.8 cannabis investors share their outlook on the European market in H1 2022\u201cLarry is attracted to the ground-up nature of the cannabis industry, which lets founders do things that cannot be done in other industries.\u201d For example, Ramsey points to the spirits industry, saying you can t build a labeling solution for such a mature market. \u201cWhen we hear founders think that way, those are the founders we gravitate towards\u2026 The founder fit for Gron is someone who wants to leverage the opportunity of the nascency of the space to make a significant impact.\u201dAccording to Lucid Green, the company s app has more than 75,000 registered users. Between 2020 and 2021, LucidIDs made their way onto 16 million products, with March 2021 seeing the creation of 1 million additional products carrying a LucidID. Based on the current trend and signed deals, the company expects to add its label to 85 million units this year.",

        "text": "Swvl, an Egyptian startup that provides shared transportation services for intercity and intracity trips, has expanded into Turkey with its recent acquisition of Volt Lines, a B2B transportation-as-a-service operator.The primarily stock deal, which was valued at around $40 million, gives Swvl access both to Volt Lines  tech as well as its more than 110 corporate client contracts. This reach will help Swvl build out its corporate offerings while also getting a foothold in Turkey so it can expand its B2C service, as well as adjacent transportation solutions, including schools and factories, the company says.Swvl s main business model involves repurposing underutilized, privately owned buses or minivans for different purposes throughout the day, such as shuttling intercity commuters along fixed routes, providing rides between cities and driving corporate employees to work or meetings.Volt provides corporate clients, like ICBC, MetLife and Axa Insurance, and their employees with a cost-effective alternative to public transportation or ride-hailing via its own network of smart routed shared buses. The company has committed to running 100% of its network on electric buses powered by renewable energy by 2030.Swvl, which joined the public markets through a special purpose acquisition merger about a month ago, said its purchase of Volt Lines would add an incremental $4.3 million of annualized revenue to its balance sheet. The acquisition, which will see Volt Lines  team hired by Swvl, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.Volt Lines is Swvl s fourth acquisition since August that has helped the company expand both its product and its geographic markets beyond UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kenya and Pakistan. Last year Swvl acquired another mass transit platform, Viapool, to expand into Argentina and Chile, as well as Spain-based Shotl, an on-demand shuttle booking platform, which allowed the company to enter Europe. More recently, Swvl announced its intention to buy Berlin-based mobility startup Door2door. The company says it now operates in 115 cities across 18 countries and four continents.Mostafa Kandil, CEO and founder of Swvl, previously told TechCrunch it intends to operate in 20 countries on five continents, including North America, by 2025, so we might expect more acquisitions in the coming months.",
